# Kanye Lyrics Generator

The goal of this project was for me to get more familiar with building things out in Golang
and I decided a fun way to do this would be to create some sort of text generator (mostly)
from scratch. Kanye has a lot of songs, and most of them are good so naturally a web app
that generated Kanye lyrics seemed suitable. The backend for the project will be completely
in Golang, and the frontend will be in SolidJS. 

## To-Dos:
- [x] Get Lyric Data
