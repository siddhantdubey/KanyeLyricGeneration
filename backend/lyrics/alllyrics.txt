DondaNo matter how many times that you told me you wanted to leave
No matter how many breaths that you took you still couldn't breathe
No matter how many nights that you lie wide awake
to the sound of the poison rain
Where did you go? 3x
Heartbeat, a heart beat
I need a heartbeat, a heartbeat
Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
No matter how many deaths that I die I will never forget
No matter how many lives I live, I will never regret
There is a fire inside of this heart and a riot about to explode into flames
Where is your God? 3x
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want? (Heartbeat, a heartbeat)
Do you really want me? (I need a heartbeat, a heartbeat)
Do you really want me dead? (You know I gotta leave, I can't stay)
Or alive to live the lie? (I know I gotta go, I can't)
Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
You say you're wrong, you're wrong, I'm right, I'm right, you're wrong, we fight
Okay, I'm running from the light, running from the day to night, oh
The quiet silence defines our misery
The riot inside keeps trying to visit me
No matter how we try, it's too much history
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So, let it breathe, let it fly, let it go
Let it fall, let it crash, burn slow
And then you call upon God
Oh, you call upon God
Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
Ooooooh, this hurricane 3x
Ooooooh
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to live a lie?
Running away from the light
Running away from the light
Running away to save your lifeHello? Hello? Hello...
Is there anybody up here?
Hello?
Welcome...2085. Twenty eighty-five it is
Just me up here I guess
The magic of the moment snuck up on me
And caught me by surprise
Roamin' and I'm lonely
But I'm only
There's somethin in your eyes
And I know it's not just the song
(And I know it's not just the song)
And I know it's not just the drink
(And I know it's not the drink)
But whatever it might be
(Whatever it might be)
Just keep holdin' on to me
Cause I'll pull down a cloud for you
I'll circle the stars and bring you one back
I'll walk through the sun for you
Cause there's somethin' you do
That got me walkin' on the moon
There's something you do
That got me walkin' on the moon
And I know that it's true
Baby you got me walkin' on the moon
Don't keep me waitin', I'm impatient
C'mon to my runway, lets take off and fly
Now I'm where I wanna be
Come co-pilot with me
Lets burn up the sky
And I know it's not just the song
(And I know it's not just the song)
And I know it's not just the drink
(And I know it's not the drink)
But whatever it might be
(Whatever it might be)
Just keep holdin on to me
Cause I'll pull down a cloud for you
I'll circle the stars and bring you one back
I'll walk through the sun for you
Cause there's somethin' you do
That got me walkin' on the moon
There's something you do
That got me walkin' on the moon
And I know that it's true
Baby you got me walkin' on the moon
Everyone out there will know that you are my girl
And my love will circle around and round
No matter what I do
Aye aye Dream I'm too good at this
Uhh, uhh, uhh, I can't contain it
No, no, no I can't restrain it
There's a lot of stars in here ain't it?
But you shine so much they don't seem famous
Where'd you come from on this lonely night?
I swear God must have made lightning strike
And I bottled it up
You hit the red carpet and modeled it up
We hopped in the 'rari and throttled it up
Now everybody clappin', they bravoed it up
All just because it's more than a buzz
More than a drink, but I took a few sips
And let it do what it does
Now drunk textin'
Like its all about you
Like I can't spend another minute without you
You know the drinks let you say things you ain't allowed to
Things that you fear, but you're way to proud to
Say out loud
Cause niggas gonna clown you
Put your black berry down
People is around you
Ill put my mack berry down
I ain't tryin to hound you
Just tryin' to take you where the stars gonna surround you
And Uhmm, maybe ice down you
And Uhmm, maybe white gown you
And Uhmm, maybe we should talk about all this after I pound you
Ha, you know I'm just playin' with you
I know a lot of people mad cause they ain't with you
Wait is it because we on the moon
Tell 'em to save the hate we'll be home soon
There's something you do
That got me walkin on the moon
Uhh, and I know that its true
Baby, you got me walkin on the moon
Everyone out there will know that you are my girlYeah

She put my paintings inside of her living room
Look at the problems and issues I'm living through
They tryna drown me, I rise to my pinnacle

Walked through the block like the neighborhood general
Drop me the low and then that′s what I send it to
I was forgetting you, now I remember, now I remember
Did what I want, and I say what I want
And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?

I got this God power, that's my leverages
I got this Holy Water, that′s my beverages
I gotta help myself out of selfishness
I just bought a floor out of Selfridges
I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
I gotta tell ′em "sorry", they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't delivering Heavenly messages just for the hell of it

Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God everyday, that′s my bestie
They playing soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me

Look at new scenes, I opened my life, I'm subject to memes
I signed a few -, I polished their dreams
An angel on Earth, come under my wing
Stop running your publishers-
They publish the headlines and say the wrong things
Y′all treat your Lord and Savior like renters′ insurance
You know what I mean?
Bada the bada the boom, I bada the boom, I bada the bing
I need a new girl, my old one was mean
I had to let go, forgave all them evils that came to my shows

I channeled them bad, all in abode
I challenge the trust, I challenge the turbulence
I came with the life
I gathered my sinners and asked if I'm right, let′s get-

Ayy, all of my n-as on Channel 5
I don′t channel ten 'til it go time
Used to throw up my uncle′s spaghetti
Been toting totes since before I was ready
Back when my mama told me that I was challenged
A single black woman, you know that she petty
I turned a heavy heart to two million dollars
I put that in totals, reverse out the day

I gotta, I gotta put on a rager one time
I swung the powder, went major one time
I know some white people serving no time
I gotta do it for me, do it for, pray for me
Doing it for all the ones dying
I wanna do it for all the ones crying
I wanna, uh, uh, uh, let's get right, huhMy soul cries out, "Hallelujah"
And I thank God for saving me
I, I thank God
Here go all your problems again (I thank God)
Three, two, one, you′re pinned (I thank God)
Uncle, now he back in the pen'
Auntie shut down again
Did she finally come to life?
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?

Don′t you wish the night would go numb?
I've been feeling low for so long
I ain't had a high in so long
I been in the dark for so long
Night is always darkest ′fore the dawn
Gotta make my mark ′fore I'm gone
I don′t wanna die alone, I don't wanna die alone
I get mad when she gone
Mad when she home, sad when she gone
Mad when she home, sad when she gone
(Lose it right now, the spirit that wants to run)
Floating on a silver lining (in the name of Jesus)
Yeah, you know where to find me, riding on a silver lining
And my God won′t deny me, tell the Devil, "Get behind me"
All the stars are aligned, lift me up every time
You know exactly where to find me
(Hallelujah, thank you Jesus, hallelujah, hallelujah)

Did those ideas ever really come to life?
Make it all come to life, make it all come to life
Praying for a change in your life
Well, maybe it's gon′ come tonight

Sadness setting in again
Three, two, one, you're pinned
Uncle right back in the pen'
Tell me, how auntie been?
Took your thoughts and penciled ′em in
Should′ve wrote 'em down in pen
And maybe they′d come to life
And maybe they'd come to life

Sadness setting in again
Three, two, one, you′re pinned
Uncle right back to the pen'
Tell me, how auntie been?
Thoughts, you had penciled ′em in
Probably should've wrote 'em in pen
And maybe they′d come to life
They could finally come to life
They could finally come to life

You know where to find me, they cannot define me
So they crucify me, how so fazed when I leave?
Come and purify me, come and sanctify me
You the air that I breathe, the ultra-ultralight beam
Bought a gift to Northie, all she want was Nikes
This is not about me, God is still alive, so I′m free
Floating on a silver lining, floating on a silver lining
So when I'm free, I′m free(Yo) yo (check our situation), yo
My men and my women
(Yo) yo (check our situation), yoMy men and my wom-

You need something unexpected (yo, yo), some form of weapon
You ask him to feel protected (yo, yo), and still feel protected
Just one time for the record (yo, yo), just one time for the record
Don′t agree with the message (yo, yo), don't agree with the methods

Don′t let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

Man, it's too early
What the hell you doing waking me up at 5:30?
Why the hell are you worried?
Play something that is very, very vibe-worthy
I don′t want my mind alerting
People saying tweeting gonna make you die early
How ′bout have my heart hurting?
Hold it all inside, that could make you die early

Go on and get your best attorney
Something's there, feel it when I heard it
Just release the spirit, let it flow though
Have these n- leaving now with one leg like Flo-Jo
Nail me to the cross with long nails like Coco
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo

I ain′t got my point across
'Til we finally get the cross and pass the point
So there′s a couple things that I gotta quote
Don't involve yourself in things you don′t have to know
I ain't never question what you was asking for
I gave you every single thing you was asking for
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off

I be going through things I had to wrote
Celebrity drama that only Brad′d know
Too many family secrets, somebody pass the notes
Things I cried about I found laughable
Lil′ baby Jesus ain't laughing, no
Don′t involve yourself in things that you ain't have to know
The big man upstairs ain′t laughing, no
Don't involve yourself in things that you ain′t have to know

Now here we are
You know I'm not about it
Showed you my all
I let you into my thoughts

Don't let, don′t let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow in love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

Okay, I didn′t throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave
I told you I loved you, but she didn't believe
You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived
By some dude who′s more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha

You said that I lie, how did I?
I told you everything, didn′t I?
But you just could not believe... man, I'm so peeved
Your friends all up in your head even when we′re in bed
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha
I'm laughing at you all, you think you got me? No, no
My back ain′t against the wall (the wall...)

Don′t let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light (right on, right on)
One last sparkle to followNo child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behindNo child left behind
No child left behind

Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y′all, never count on y'all
Always count on God
Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y′all, never count on y'all
Always count on Godㅤ

Ain't nobody ′round me losing sleep
Better find God ′fore He find me
Tell the Devil, "Good night, go to sleep"Two lessons that he passed along to his children
The first is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
The second was that, no matter what, you love unconditionallyIt is that kind of love that made my father the kind of father
And the kind of man he is
He vowed that he would never walk away from his family
And he never has

You know why my spirit′s calling
Darkness can't take light from me
Haven′t you gone far enough?
Sacrificed the ones you love
Gave up on your sanity
Like some twisted fantasy
What would I say to everything
Your actions cost everything

My, my, my family
My family, I'm losing my family
I'm losing my family
Losing my family

Cried out to you in my sleep, you thought it was a dream
"Why won′t you answer me? I′m in the room"
"Tell mom you're sorry", she′s screaming at me
"Daddy, how could you leave? Daddy, how could you leave?"

"Come back tonight, daddy, please, come back tonight, daddy, please"
"Daddy, how could you leave? Daddy, how could you leave?"
She don't know what this means, "How′d you become so mean?"
I wish I never screamed, alcohol when you breathe
These things, these things, these things, these things, they sting
"Daddy promise you'll stay, don′t you love me? Love me"

Two lessons that he passed along to his children
The first is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family

Well, he said something that was a little bit dangerous
He told me I could talk about anything I wanted to
And you know, I am my son′s mother
The man I described in the introduction is being so decidedly different, my son (every time)
And what made the project extra special to me is
I got a chance to share not only what he has meant to me
But what he has meant to a generation (today's the time)
As one writer said, we came from somewhere
Not just from the wombs of our mothers and the seeds of our fathers
But from a long line of generations who came before us

Everything I′m doing now is God′s plan
Doctor said I wouldn't walk no more, now I stand
Then I ran, here I am, Machine

Keep my spirit alive
More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side

Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast-food
Bad-had tools and a bad mood
If you don′t turn to a Lil Gotti
They gon' drain all the strength in your lil′ body
They turned me into a Lil Gotti, uh, yeah

Who the squad? Donda

Who can see? Don, duh, get Don C
Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals
And I don′t do commercials ′cause they too commercial
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you
She said, "You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you"
How I′m 42 and you got a curfew?
How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?

Quiet all the cordialness
We walk in God′s spiritual ordinance
We know the blacks, the orphans, refused to be runaways
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid

Spirit won't die-ie
Oh-oh-oh, my life, yeah
Is in his hands, so I don′t stress, I pray and strategizeTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we′ve been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

Sittin' by myself, I′m just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreaming (Jesus)
Man, it′s hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Lord)
I watched so many people leave (Jesus, Lord)
I see ′em change by the season, that's mama′s seasonin'
God got you, the devil′s watchin', he just peekin′ in
I know I made a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losing all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I′ve been swimmin′ on the deepest end

It's just drugs, it ain′t no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don′t even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin′ what's up there (Lord)
And while they introduce a party, they say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Then they tell you that you good, and just stay focused (Lord)

Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
Movin′ to the hood was like signin′ up for the army
'Cause they been killin′ n-, since n- was watchin' Barney (Jesus)

You want dreams to come true? But I had nightmares (Lord)
′Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I′m just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night tears when the night clears

And if I talk to Christ, could I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
And better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he′s just one of the mystic
And mama steady crying, ′cause she really the victim (Jesus)
Now she's getting high and she′s getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid

That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it
16, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can′t afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it′s finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom

Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin′ numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs ′cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
But is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don′t feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side

He seein′ red it's like he′s bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
He even let him get they last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, "N-, stand still" (Jesus)
"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry" (Lord)
"Tell me one reason I shouldn′t send you up to Christ"
He said, "Go ′head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ"
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was just the light (Jesus, Lord)

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God
The beneficent, the merciful (hallelujah)
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica
It′s Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor (sheesh)
Back from the great beyond, the son of man and the son of Donda (Jesus)

I never rolled the GXSR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana
In Tenochtitlan they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco
I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal

The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel′s Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yakub with two pieces of steel
My sword or my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took an L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I′m in the fight here, fight here, for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
30 pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It′s like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

I was born to rock a crown, h- yeah, I knocked it down
Holy water, n-, but out here, we turn to brown (Jesus)
Donnie, if you ain't loyal, you from a different soil (Lord)
Your flame too low for that water to boil (you ain't hot)

If I wasn′t rappin′, the calls would stop (haha)
You ain't really happy for me, you mad that I pop (Jesus)
F- a car, five houses like, "Look what I copped" (Lord)
Devil like, "Jesus Christ, he gotta be stopped"
I don′t say, "What's up?", you basically blocked (facts)
You see it on my head, just know that it′s copped (Jesus)
Always look 'em in the face when I deal with my opp (Lord)
I′m from the bottom but Lord knows it's better up top, n-

Yeah, viral pictures (viral), Bible scriptures
One thing about the devil, he's liable to get you (Jesus)
Long as my good days outweigh my bad days (Lord)
I don′t count the money, I just know how much the bag weighs (I know)
Broke down soon as I seen him bring the coffin in
Lord knows, I just really wanna see you walk again (Jesus) (uh)
Million dollars cashiers check to the offerin′ (Lord)
They can talk about me all they want, I'ma talk to Him (uh-huh)

He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things

What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you
For taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could′ve did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance
We can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know to me it kinda feels like, me, my mother, my brothers
And my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail

We've been looked at and treated as criminals, for being a part of this family
My father′s truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community
′Cause the conditions in this capitalist society
Is what made him, and it's what made the children of today
After 25 years of bein′ locked down, 23 and 1
My father has not called any shots
From one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released
Call any of the shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the hell that he has had to live in for the past 26 years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn′t sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that

All my life, man, I′ve been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home
Now I′m a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son
He graduated eighth grade and we still waitin′
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged
Kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven′t been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
Who deserves to breathe free air

No matter how many breaths that you took you still couldn't breathe
No matter how many nights that you lie wide awake
to the sound of the poison rain
Where did you go? 3x
Heartbeat, a heart beat
I need a heartbeat, a heartbeat
Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
No matter how many deaths that I die I will never forget
No matter how many lives I live, I will never regret
There is a fire inside of this heart and a riot about to explode into flames
Where is your God? 3x
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want? (Heartbeat, a heartbeat)
Do you really want me? (I need a heartbeat, a heartbeat)
Do you really want me dead? (You know I gotta leave, I can't stay)
Or alive to live the lie? (I know I gotta go, I can't)
Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
You say you're wrong, you're wrong, I'm right, I'm right, you're wrong, we fight
Okay, I'm running from the light, running from the day to night, oh
The quiet silence defines our misery
The riot inside keeps trying to visit me
No matter how we try, it's too much history
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So, let it breathe, let it fly, let it go
Let it fall, let it crash, burn slow
And then you call upon God
Oh, you call upon God
Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
Ooooooh, this hurricane 3x
Ooooooh
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to live a lie?

Have these n- leaving now with one leg like Flo-Jo
Nail me to the cross with long nails like Coco
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo

I ain′t got my point across
'Til we finally get the cross and pass the point
So there′s a couple things that I gotta quote
Don't involve yourself in things you don′t have to know
I ain't never question what you was asking for
I gave you every single thing you was asking for
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off

I be going through things I had to wrote
Celebrity drama that only Brad′d know
Too many family secrets, somebody pass the notes
Things I cried about I found laughable
Lil′ baby Jesus ain't laughing, no
Don′t involve yourself in things that you ain't have to know
The big man upstairs ain′t laughing, no
Don't involve yourself in things that you ain′t have to know

Now here we are
You know I'm not about it
Showed you my all
I let you into my thoughts

Don't let, don′t let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow in love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

Okay, I didn′t throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave
I told you I loved you, but she didn't believe
You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived
By some dude who′s more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha

You said that I lie, how did I?
I told you everything, didn′t I?
But you just could not believe... man, I'm so peeved
Your friends all up in your head even when we′re in bed
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha
I'm laughing at you all, you think you got me? No, no
My back ain′t against the wall (the wall...)

Don′t let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love

Welcome...2085. Twenty eighty-five it is
Just me up here I guess
The magic of the moment snuck up on me
And caught me by surprise
Roamin' and I'm lonely
But I'm only
There's somethin in your eyes
And I know it's not just the song
(And I know it's not just the song)
And I know it's not just the drink

But whatever it might be

Just keep holdin' on to me
Cause I'll pull down a cloud for you
I'll circle the stars and bring you one back
I'll walk through the sun for you
Cause there's somethin' you do
That got me walkin' on the moon
There's something you do
That got me walkin' on the moon
And I know that it's true
Baby you got me walkin' on the moon
Don't keep me waitin', I'm impatient
C'mon to my runway, lets take off and fly
Now I'm where I wanna be
Come co-pilot with me
Lets burn up the sky
And I know it's not just the song
(And I know it's not just the song)
And I know it's not just the drink

Uhh, uhh, uhh, I can't contain it
No, no, no I can't restrain it
There's a lot of stars in here ain't it?
But you shine so much they don't seem famous
Where'd you come from on this lonely night?
I swear God must have made lightning strike
And I bottled it up
You hit the red carpet and modeled it up
We hopped in the 'rari and throttled it up
Now everybody clappin', they bravoed it up
All just because it's more than a buzz
More than a drink, but I took a few sips
And let it do what it does
Now drunk textin'
Like its all about you
Like I can't spend another minute without you
You know the drinks let you say things you ain't allowed to
Things that you fear, but you're way to proud to
Say out loud
Cause niggas gonna clown you
Put your black berry down
People is around you
Ill put my mack berry down
I ain't tryin to hound you
Just tryin' to take you where the stars gonna surround you
And Uhmm, maybe ice down you

Everyone out there will know that you are my girlChildren growing, women producing
Men go work and some go stealing
Everyone′s got to make a living
No more promos, no more photos
No more logos, no more chokeholds
We on Bezos, we get payrolls
Trips to Lagos, connect like LEGOs
Make this final, make this, my eyes closed
Burn false idols, Jesus disciples
I can feel your pain now, I done bled my vein out
New level the game now, simulation changed
No more problems, no more argue

This that level, make devils pray, now

Hold up, no peace, hold up, police
Don't call police, just stay focused
Pray for new life, pray for new breath
Hey, Lord, make sure it′s safe for who is left
Know you can′t find a place to rest
Know the Lord my bulletproof vest
When we survive, know that we blessed
Save my people through the music

It feels good to be home
And to all of you, I thank you so much for your support
For your support of me for so many years
And more importantly, for the work you continue to do
What did he want me to talk about?
Well, he said something that was a little bit dangerous
He told me I could talk about anything I wanted to
And you know, I am my son′s mother
The man I described in the introduction is being so decidedly different, my son (every time)
And what made the project extra special to me is
I got a chance to share not only what he has meant to me
But what he has meant to a generation (today's the time)
As one writer said, we came from somewhere
Not just from the wombs of our mothers and the seeds of our fathers
But from a long line of generations who came before us

Is the kingdom (is the kingdom)
And the power (and the power)
And the glory (and the glory)

I′m the illest - and I mean it (and I mean it)
My homie dropping bodies for no reason (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)

You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Spirit won′t die-ie
Oh-oh-oh, my life, yeah
Is in his hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize

Yeah, don′t hate me 'cause my heart is full of love
No weapon formed against me ′cause I'm covered in the blood
Laying in the hospital when I got shot, fam
Mama prayed for me, said she left it in God′s hands, yeah
So I'ma leave it in God's hands
Everything I′m doing now is God′s plan
Doctor said I wouldn't walk no more, now I stand
Then I ran, here I am, Machine

Keep my spirit alive
More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side

Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast-food
Bad-had tools and a bad mood
If you don′t turn to a Lil Gotti
They gon' drain all the strength in your lil′ body
They turned me into a Lil Gotti, uh, yeah
Not Wakanda, but Wakanda is kinda like what we 'bout to make
And who gon′ make it? Kan', duh

Who the squad? Donda
Who the mom? Donda
Who can see? Don, duh, get Don C
Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals
And I don′t do commercials ′cause they too commercial
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you
She said, "You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you"
How I′m 42 and you got a curfew?
How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?

Quiet all the cordialness
We walk in God′s spiritual ordinance
We know the blacks, the orphans, refused to be runaways
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid

More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Spirit won't die-ie
Oh-oh-oh, my life, yeah
Is in his hands, so I don′t stress, I pray and strategizeTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now, we′ve been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

Sittin' by myself, I′m just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreamin′
Man, it′s hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus, Lord)
I watched so many people leave
I see 'em change by the season, that′s mama's seasonin′
God got you, the devil's watchin′, he just peekin' in
I know I made a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I′ve been losin′ all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I've been swimmin′ on the deepest end

It's just drugs, it ain′t no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don′t even know what's upstairs
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what′s up there (Jesus, Lord)
And while I introduce the party, they say it′s up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Then they tell you that you good and just stay focused (Lord)

Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin′ up for the army
'Cause they been killin′ n- since n- was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)
′Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here

Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reachin′ for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I′m light years ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night terrors when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
And better have a strategy or you could be a statistic

Little boy dies, he′s just one of the mystic
And mama steady cryin' ′cause she really the victim (Jesus)
Now she's gettin′ high and she's gettin' addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That′s a family portrait and her daughter just absorbed it
16, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can′t afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up

Now she just feelin′ nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she′s still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin′ numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doin' drugs 'cause that′s the only time she feel loved (Lord)
But is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?

From all the pain that been built up, but they don′t feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleedin′ from the side
He seein' red, it′s like he's bleedin′ through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grievin' up inside (Jesus)
He even let him get they last meal (Lord)
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill

He gotta show him that it′s that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, "N-, stand still" (Jesus)
"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry" (Lord)
"Tell me one reason I shouldn′t send you up to Christ"
He said, "Go 'head, take my life, I′ve seen everything but Christ"
The big bro just blacked out and all you seein' was the light (Jesus, Lord)

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God
The beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)
Thank you for bringin′ me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (sheesh)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin′ through your monitor
Back from the great beyond, the Son of Man and the son of Donda (Jesus)
I never rolled the GXSR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda

Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana
In Tenochtitlan they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Jesus)
I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal (Lord)
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel

My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took an L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I′m in the fight here, fight here, for what seemed like light years (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
30 pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It′s a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It′s like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
We've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr.
First and foremost, I wanna thank you
For taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could′ve did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance
We can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know to me it kinda feels like, me, my mother, my brothers
And my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail

We′ve been looked at and treated as criminals, for being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community
'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society
Is what made him, and it′s what made the children of today
After 25 years of bein′ locked down, 23 and 1
My father has not called any shots
From one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released
Call any of the shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the hell that he has had to live in for the past 26 years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn′t sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that

All my life, man, I′ve been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain′t home
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son
He graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn′t hugged
Kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven′t been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
Who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)N-, we made it

N-, we made it
N-, we made it

N-, we made it (grr, woo, bah)
N-, we made it, we made it (woo)
N-, we made it (woo)
Thank God that I made it
N-, we made it, we made it (woo)
Look, momma, I made it

Look, I remember the days, same fit for a week straight
I used to eat 50-cent cake, now it′s Philippe's
It′s Philippe's for the steak, buy it, I don't care what it cost
And I always keep a pole, I did a hundred on a pro
If you droppin′ a woo, we come where you live
Glock 9, infrared, pull up and empty the clip
Dread had the strap all summer in the Floss movin′ reckless
Please do not play with me, n-, I keep a K with me

N-, we made it (grr, woo)
N-, we made it, we made it (woo)
N-, we made it (woo)
Thank God that I made it(Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me)
Wrap your arms around with Your mercy
(Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me)I give up on doin′ things my way
(And tell me everything is going to be alright, Lord)

When you said give me a ring, you really meant a ring, huh?
Turned out to be more than just a fling, huh?
Three hours to get back from Palm Springs, huh?
Who you know spend an hour in Walgreens, huh?
You know you'll always be my favorite prom queen
Even when we in dad shoes, or mom jeans
Too many complaints made it hard for me to think
Would you shut up? I can′t hear myself drink

We used to do the freak like seven days a week
It's the best collab since Taco Bell and KFC, uh
Talk to me nicely, don't come at me loud
You had a Benz at 16, I could barely afford an Audi
How you gonna try to say sometimes it′s not about me
Man, I don′t know what I would do without me

Billionaire sport, step up to the court
They rented a room, we bought the resort
God got me, baby, God got the children
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'
Time went silence, a luxury
Cussin′ at your baby momma, guess that's why they call it custody
God got us baby, God got the children
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin′
Time and space is a luxury
But you came here to show that you still in love with me

Startin' to feel like you ain′t been happy for me lately, darlin'
'Member when you used to come around and serenade me, woah
(And tell me everything is going to be alright, Lord)
But I guess it′s gone different in a different direction lately
Tryna do the right thing with the freedom that you gave me (Wheezy outta here)

Your gun off safety, speak first don′t break me
(And tell me everything is going to be alright, Lord)
Harsh words, you're angry
Lord, don′t take me, oh, oh

(Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me)
Wrap your arms around with your mercy
(Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me)
I give up on doin' things my way
(And tell me everything is going to be alright, Lord) (Wheezy outta here)God is King, we the soldiers
Ultra beam out the solar
When I get to Heaven′s gatesI ain't gotta peak over

Keepin′ perfect composure
When I scream at the chauffeur
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
I ain′t mean, I′m just focused

Pour the lean out slower
Got us clean out of soda
Before the flood, people judge
They did the same thing to Noah

Everybody wanted Yandhi
Then Jesus Christ did the laundry
They say the week start on Monday
But the strong start on Sunday

Won't be in bondage to any man
John 8:33, we the descendants of Abraham
Ye should be made free, John 8:36
To whom the Son set free is free indeed
He saved a wretch like me

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah
He is wonderful

If you woke then wake up
With Judas kiss and make up
Even with the bitter cup
Forgave my brothers and drank up

Did everything but gave up
Stab my back, I can′t front
Still we win, we prayed up
Even when we die, we raise up

Ain't no wantin′, no, we need it
The powers that be done been greedy
We need ours by this evening
No white flag or no treaty

We got the product, we got the tools
We got the minds, we got the youth
We goin' wild, we on the loose
People is lying, we are the truth

Everything old shall now become new
The leaves will be green, bearing the fruit
Love God and our neighbor as written in Luke
The army of God and we are the truth

Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo

Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hooFather I stretch

Stretch my hands to you
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it′s really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don′t even like likes
I was screaming at my Dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screaming at the referee just like Mike
Looking for a bright light, Sigel, "What Your Lifelike"

Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to you)
Pressing on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screaming at my Dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you′re being like Christ
Only ever seein′ me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searching for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let′s just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light

Driving with my Dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like" (Stretch my hands to you)
I′m just tryna find, l've been looking for a new way
I′m just really tryna not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, being on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin′ else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father I stretch)
Wrestlin′ with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it′s really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to you)
Arguing with my Dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"

Man

You know, it′s like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all good, then I tried to talk to my Dad (Stretch my hands to you)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin′ on me
I start spazzin' back, he said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
Hold the selfies, put the ′Gram awayGet your family, y'all hold hands and pray

When you get daughters, always keep ′em safe
Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate

Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
You're my number one with the lemonade
Raise our sons, train them in the faith
Through temptations, make sure they′re wide awake

Follow Jesus, listen and obey
No more living for the culture, we nobody′s slave

Stand up for my home
Even if I take this walk alone
I bow down to the King upon the throne
My life is His, I'm no longer my own

I pray to God that He′ll strengthen my hand
They will think twice stepping onto my land
I draw the line that's written in the sand
Try me and you will see that I ain′t playin'

Nah, back up off my family, move yo hands
I got my weapons in the Spirit′s land
Ah, Jezebel don't even stand a chance
Jezebel don't even stand a chance

Chick-fil-AHow you get so much favor on your side?
"Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour," I replied
Thou should love thy neighbor, not divideI′ma ride, that's on God

His lights shine the brightest in the dark
Single mothers know they got my heart
And all my brothers locked up on the yard
You can still be anything you wanna be

Went from one in four to one in three
Thirteenth amendment, gotta′ end it, that's on me
He the new commander and the chief
That's on Keef, that′s on God

Before the ranch, I had horses in the garage
When the Forbes cover was just a mirage
They had me chasin′ statues, that's on pride
Oh my God, Bust said, "That′s on Tribe"

When I thought the Book of Job was a job
The Devil had my soul, I can't lie
Life gon′ have some lows and some highs
Before the Grammy's ever gave a nod

I wore my heart on my sleeve, I couldn′t hide
In '03 they told me not to drive
I bleached my hair for every time I could've died
But I survived, that′s on God

I′ve been tellin' y′all since '05
The greatest artist restin′ or alive
That's on L.A. Reid, that′s on Clive
That's no jive, that's on God

Off the 350s, he supplied
The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe
Man, that′s over half of the pie
I felt dry, that′s on God

That's why I charge the prices that I charge
I can′t be out here dancing with the stars
No, I cannot let my family starve
I go hard, that's on GodGod is my light in darkness, oh
God, God is, He
He is my all and all (And I′ll never turn back)God is

Everything that has breath, praise the Lord
Worship Christ with the best of your portions
I know I won't forget all He′s done
He's the strength in this race that I run

Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness
And it shows just how much He is miraculous
I can′t keep it to myself, I can′t sit here and just be still
Everybody, I will tell to the whole world, it's Him

King of Kings, Lord of Lords
All the things He has in store
From the rich to the poor
All are welcome through the door
You won′t ever be the same
When you call on Jesus' name
Listen to the words I′m saying
Jesus saved me, now I'm sane

And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up
I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup
I know God is alive, yeah
He has opened up my vision giving me a revelation

This ain′t 'bout a damn religion
Jesus brought a revolution
All the captives are forgiven
Time to break down all the prisons
Every man, every woman
There is freedom from addiction
Jesus, You have my soul
Sunday Service on a roll

All my idols, let 'em go
All the demons, let ′em know
This a mission, not a show
This is my eternal soul
This my kids, this the crib
This my wife, this my life
This my God-given right
Thank you, Jesus won the fight

That′s what God is
That's what God is
That′s what God isEvery knee shall bow

The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so
Today I thought about killing you
Premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say "don't say this, don't say that"
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today I thought about killing you
Premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say something good
To compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really
Really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was trying to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright it's no sun, get so loud I hear none
Screamed so loud got no lungs, hurt so bad I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prrt-pum-pum-pum
Set the Newtone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need coconut rum, I taste coke on her tongue

Niggas is savage
Niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps,
Niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters,

Father forgive me,
I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I'll make her a monster
Not havin' menages
I'm just being silly
I answered the door, like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga do we have a problem?
Matter of fact Marlin, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No daddy don't play
Not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress
I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she's in
If you whip her ass, she move in with him
Then he whip her ass
You go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas,
But yesterday is dead, yeah
Moment of silence
Next she'll be off to college
And then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage
Niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps
Niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps
Niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters

So why send depression not blessings?
Why, oh why'd you do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
(To save) Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light
(Lord) To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
Cause I, I look to the light

I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said let's do a good ass job with Chance three
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'mma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'mma still give them raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light

All his time, all he had, all he had
In what he dreamed
All his cash, market crashed
Hurt him bad, people get divorced for that
Drops some stacks pops is good

Driving fast, lost control
Off the road, jaw was broke
'Member we all was broke
'Member I'm coming back
I'll be taking all the stacks

Swizz told me let the beat rock
For all my Southside niggas that know me best

Why? I made that bitch famous (God damn)

If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (God damn)

You want me to give you a testimony about my life, and how good he's been to me. I don't know what to tell you about him, I love him so much with all my heart and my soul with every bone in my body I love him so much because he's done so much for me.
Every morning, every day of my life. I won't always be crying tears in the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up by myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day. I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do and how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it, how I'm gonna get there, because he... he's gonna be there for me. Some day the sky above will open up and he will reach out his hand and guide me through, oh yes he will. I won't always be crying these tears. I won't always be feeling so blue. Some day, he will open up the door for me and call my name. Some day he will. I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like.
No matter what you've been through or where you've been he's always there, with his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much, I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to. I'm crying now, it feels so good to be free, to be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what, oh lord thank you, you are the joy of my life.feat. Young Thug

For my, lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul, my soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

I wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that last time, the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times that you say don't text me hoe
Told you four times, don't test me, hoe
Now we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah, I'mma have the laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
And I...

I wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up

See through the veil
And forget all of your cares
Throw them, throw them away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Nah, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
See through the veil
And forget all your cares
Throw them, throw them away
Oh, life's a feeling
Oh, the body's a feelingReal friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' after communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be
Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, to the real end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "what's up, fam, hope you good"
You say, "I'm good" then great, the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I

It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it
She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet
I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!

Back in the lab and shit
My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with with no permission, on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25
And you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, father, father...)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
The night sky, yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah
I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout "how my neck look?"
Well... it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (real)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams
One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern day MJ with a off the wall flow
My life, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent to you, bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible
Now I'm visible to you
Oh the invisible truths they sold
I can't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand
Understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here
And stood by me
And look at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, father, father...)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife

So why send depression not blessings?
Why, oh why'd you do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
(To save) Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light
(Lord) To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
Cause I, I look to the light
[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain

They don't know, they don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til they drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics and spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said let's do a good ass job with Chance three
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'mma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'mma still give them raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light

'Member I'm coming back

You want me to give you a testimony about my life, and how good he's been to me. I don't know what to tell you about him, I love him so much with all my heart and my soul with every bone in my body I love him so much because he's done so much for me.
Every morning, every day of my life. I won't always be crying tears in the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up by myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day. I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do and how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it, how I'm gonna get there, because he... he's gonna be there for me. Some day the sky above will open up and he will reach out his hand and guide me through, oh yes he will. I won't always be crying these tears. I won't always be feeling so blue. Some day, he will open up the door for me and call my name. Some day he will. I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like.
No matter what you've been through or where you've been he's always there, with his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much, I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to. I'm crying now, it feels so good to be free, to be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what, oh lord thank you, you are the joy of my life.feat. Young Thug

The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye," man that would be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanyefeat. Chris Brown

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I been waiting for a minute
For my, lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul, my soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul
[Hook: The Weeknd]
I wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that last time, the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times that you say don't text me hoe
Told you four times, don't test me, hoe
Now we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah, I'mma have the laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
And I...
[Hook: The Weeknd]
I wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
I wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
[Outro: Section 25 & Kanye West]
See through the veil
And forget all of your cares
Throw them, throw them away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Nah, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
See through the veil
And forget all your cares
Throw them, throw them away
Oh, life's a feeling
Oh, the body's a feelingReal friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' after communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be
Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, to the real end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "what's up, fam, hope you good"
You say, "I'm good" then great, the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I

Baby lion goes
Where the islands go
[Verse 1]
You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
Ándale Ándale E.I, E.I, uh, oh

You was the best of all time at the time though
Yeah, you wasn't mine though
[Hook]
But I still drove 30 hours
But still drove 30 hours to you
[Verse 2]
I remember rapping for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need that happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in hurr, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, 3 stars for you
You call down for an omelet
Girl it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob
Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga's dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job

From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)
Please (shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (shake that body, party that body)
Please (shake that body, party that body)
Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it
She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet
I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy
Scary
Scary
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money, money, money, money
Big, big money, money, money, money
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know who can take your place
Please, no more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)

Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasinsIt’s too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than Cochran (Huh)

He’ll give us what we need
It may not be what we want
[Verse 2]
Baby girl tryna get a nut
And her girl tryna give it up
Chopped em both down
Don’t judge ‘em Joe Brown
One last announcement
No sports bra, lets keep it bouncin
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the blue spot she try to sip the fountain
That when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in put my dick in her mouth
[Hook]For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by any means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking
Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doing shit
Them niggas ain't doing shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)

But I am a close high
Mi casa es su casa
That's that cosa nostra
I am a god
I am a god My momma was raised in an era when,
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself.
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And there's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come here, please buy more"
What you want a Bentley, fur coat and diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things
Used to only be niggas now everybody play me
Spending everything on Alexander Wang

But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and there's followers

But this man can’t handle his weed
On Chicago, south of town

Bitch I'm back out my coma

Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay I smashed your Corolla
I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own yah
One more fuck and I can own yah
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin'
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on you sofa

You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover

Chasin′ love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

I just wanna clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
And I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah I told you to wait
So I'mma need a little more time now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah and I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want somethin' out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you naughty
So let's get on with it
[Hook 1]
You could've been somebody
'Stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
It came out of your body
It came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore yah
Before the love life stole yah
Remember we were so young
When I would hold yah
Before the glory
I know there ain't wrong with me
[Bridge]
Something strange is happening
[Hook 2]
You could've been somethin'
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it all our first party
When we tried our first molly
It came out of our body
It came out of our body
[Verse 2]
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyers?
It's like I don't even know yah
I gotta bring it back to the 'Nolia
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
I'll ride for my niggas, I'll die for my niggas
[Verse 3]To all my second string bitches, trying to get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you call me crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyonce, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like "Bad bitch alert"
He Instagram his watch like "Mad rich alert"
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two thousand dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she pregnant ain't it
That's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
Or that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That going to that owing money that the court got
On and on that alimony
Yeah, yeah she got you homey

Maybe it's cause
She into Leo's and I was into trios
Plus all the trips to Rio couldn't have helped
It's gettin' cold, better bring your ski clothes
Pick it through the keyhole, the door locked by myself
And I'm feelin' it right now
Cause it's the time when my heart got shot
Blocka blocka, blocka, blocka blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelin's like Zulu, then nothin' is a Shaka
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big PoppaOn to the next saga

Rockstar bitch call me Elvis
MOB, she call me selfish
Success got them jealous
Shorty's killin', while I'm drillin'
Tattoos, I'mma break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night my bitches came in twos
And they both suck like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
Cause niggas had cocaine to move
I be goin' hard, I got a name to prove
Killin' them [?] pain improve

We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This the greatest shit in the club since In Da Club
It's so packed I might ride around
With no bodyguard back like Prince in the club
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evening endWhen I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancing close to him
Yeezus just rose again

She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirtyI know I got a bad reputation
Walkin' 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, yo ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty winin' 'round all these Jamaicans
Ugh, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit

After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can’t get spunk on the mink
I mean damn what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, aye yo we made it, Thanksgiving
So aye, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the coliseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rollin' in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wonderin' if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here ballin', I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy, laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption
Coke on her black skin made a stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission'
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody wit'out tellin' me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun comin' up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinkin' 'bout the girl in all-leopard
Who was rubbin' the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by monogamy"
That's somethin' that the pastor don't preach
That's somethin' that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money we can't keep
But we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive
All right, all right

Don’t let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I’m bout to kill it
How you know, I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don’t let me into my zone
I’m definitely in my zoneIt makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't be regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
(Sounds so soulful, don't you agree?)
I invented swag, poppin bottles, putting supermodels in the cab
Proof, I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert: Hublots
Or the big face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes
Damn Yeezy and Hov, where the hell ya been?
Niggas talking real reckless; stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond them
Now I'm about to make them tuck their whole summer in
They say I'm crazy, but I'm about to go dumb again
They ain't seen me cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another 'gain
Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth
I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya
Flee in the G450 I might surface
Political refugee asylum can be purchased
Everything's for sale
I got 5 passports, I'm never going to jail
I made Jesus Walks, so I'm never going to hell
Couture level flow is never going on sale
Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive
I get it custom, you a customer
You ain't accustomed to going through customs
You ain't been nowhere, hah?
And all the ladies in the house got them showing off
I'm done I'll hit you up maña... nah!
Welcome to Havana
Smoking Cubana's with Castro in cabanas
Viva Mexico, Cubano
Dominicano, all the plugs that I know
Driving Benzes with no benefits
Not bad, huh, for some immigrants?
Build your fences, we digging tunnels
Can't you see we gettin money up under you?
Can't you see the private jets flying over you?
Maybach bumper sticker reads: "What would Hova do?"
Jay is chilling, Ye is chilling
What more can I say? We killing 'em
Hold up before we end this campaign
As you can see we done bodied the damn lames
Lord please let them accept the things they can't change
And pray that all of their pain be champagne[Kanye West:]

 Yeah, me and the RZA connect
 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (It's a new life for me)
 (For me, for me)
 (Oooh, oooh)
 (And I'm feelin' good)
 And I'll never let my son have an ego
 He'll be nice to everyone, wherever we go
 I mean, I might even make 'em be Republican
 So everybody know he love white people
 And I'll never let 'em leave his college girlfriend
 And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
 And I'll never let 'em ever hit the telethon
 I mean even if people dyin' and the world ends
 See, I just want 'I'm to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
 Just want 'I'm to be someone people like
 Don't want 'I'm to be hated, all the time judged
 Don't be like your daddy that would never budge
 And I'll never let 'I'm ever hit a strip club
 I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
 And I'll never let his mom move to L.A.
 Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure, now we all pray
 (Sun in the sky)
 (You know how I feel)
 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (It's a new life for me)
 Me and the RZA connect
 (For me, for me)
 Me and the RZA connect (Oooh, oooh)
 (And I'm feelin' good)
[Jay-Z:]
 Sorry junior, I already ruined ya
 'Cause you ain't even alive, paparazzi pursuin' ya
 Sins of a father make yo' life ten times harder
 I just wanna take ya to a barber
 Bondin' on charters, all the shit that I never did
 Teach ya good values, so you cherish it
 Took me 26 years to find my path
 My only job is cuttin' the time in half
 So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
 Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
 Look a man dead in his eyes
 So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
 And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
 I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
 Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
 Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
 Never repeat him, never repeat him
 (Sun in the sky)
 (You know how I feel)

 Welcome to the jungle
 Welcome to the jungle well [x2]
[Kanye West:]
 I asked her where she wanna be when she 25.
 She turned around and looked at me and said "alive"
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
[Jay-Z:]
 Black Axl Rose, Move halfs and wholes
 Come down to the jungle, Just ask for Hov
 Move blocks and squares, Move apples and pears
 Work pots and pans, Just to cop me some Airs
 My uncle died, My Daddy did too
 Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
 My nephew gone, My heart is torn
 Sometimes I look to the sky, Ask why I was born
 My faith in God, Every day is hard
 Every night is worse, That's why I pray so hard
[Kanye West:]
 Why I pray so hard, This is crazy God
 Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
 So que sera, Get a case of Syrah
 Let it chase the pain, Before it goes too far
[Jay-Z:]
 My dreams is big, Reality set in
 Let off a clip from a automatic weapon,
 Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
 Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it
 I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise
 Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
 I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin
 I ball at the mall, Beginning of the ending
 Where the fuck is the sun?
 It's been a while, Momma, look at ya son
 What happened to my smile?
 My tears is tatted My rag in my pocket
 I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it
 Champagne for the pain, Weed for the low
 God damn I'm so high, Where the fuck did I go?
 I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
 I look in the mirror, My only opponent
 Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?
 Either they know or don't care I'm fucking depressed
 No crying in public, Just lying to judges
 Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it well
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
 Goddammit!This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars, Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for?
[Kanye West:]
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z & Kanye West:]
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Who gon stop me?

 One neck but got 8 charms
[Jay-Z & Kanye West:]
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Kanye West:]
 Niggaas talkin, they bitch made, Ix-nay off my dicks-nay
 That's pig latin, itch-bay
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Last night ain't go so well
 Got kicked up out the hotel
 Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
 Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
 You just a commentator, If you getting paper
 Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
 In some relations, You just supposed to say none
 Heard she fucked the doorman
 Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
 Heard Yeezy was racist, Well, I guess that's on one basis
 I only like green faces
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars
 Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for
[Kanye West:]
 Ya'll weed purple, My money purple
 Ya'll Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah circle
 I wrote the verse, That I hope will hurt you
[Jay-Z:]
 Who gone stop me huh?
 Beat the odds, Best the Feds
 It wouldn't be wise, To bet against the kid
 Start me broke, I bet I get rich
 Night shift, 6 to 6
 Gimmie one shot, One pot
 I'll show up in all white, Wearing no socks
 No ceiling, New coupe
 They know I'm a dope boy
 They don't have no proof
 I'm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
 It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
 I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
 I'm at the table, I'm gambling,
 Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
 I went through hell, I'm expecting heaven, I'm owed,
 I'm throwed And I stuck to the G-code,
 I'm here, Oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere,
 Ok here, Like a hare, Like a rabbit, I like karats
 I'm allergic to having bunny ears,
 Like broke, Like nope, Like ha,
 I ain't no joke, I can't be stopped
 Like nope, Like nope
 To the beat Noah...
 2 seats in the 911 No limit on the black card
 Told ya'll I was gonna go HAM, To the ocean was my backyard
 No lies in my verses, Please pardon all the curses
 Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
 Middle finger to my old life, Special shout out to my old head
 If it wasn't for your advice, A nigga would have been so dead
 I'm living life, Til these niggas kill me
 Turn this up, If these niggas feel me
 I'm riding dirty, Trying to get filthy
 Pabalo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
 Graduated to the MOMA
 And I did all of this, Without a diploma
 Graduated from the corner
 Ya'll can play me
 For a motherfuckin fool if you wanna,
 Street smart, And I'm book smart
 Could have been a chemist, Cause I cook smart
 Only thing that can stop me is me, And I'm a stop when the hook start
 Hold up
[Kanye West:]
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die, I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars
 Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for[Jay-Z:]
 Bloody Murder, murder murder [x4]
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
[Jay-Z:]
 This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
 Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
 Strays from the same shade, Ni**a we on the same team
 Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
 All black everything, Ni**a you know my fresh code
 I'm out here fightin' for you, Don't increase my stress load
 Ni**as watchin' the throne, Very happy to be
 Power to the people, When you see me, see you
[Kanye West:]
 And I'm from the murder capital, Where they murder for capital
 Heard about at least 3 killings this afternoon
 Lookin' at the news like damn I was just with him after school,
 No shop class but half the school got a tool,
 And I could die any day type attitude
 Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
 It's time for us to stop and re-define black power
 41 souls murdered in 50 hours
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder,
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
 Murder again...
 Is it genocide?
 Cause I can still hear his momma cry, Know the family traumatized
 Shots left holes in his face, Bout piranha-size
 The old pastor closed the cold casket
 And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
 It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
 I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
 314 soldiers died in Iraq
 509 died in Chicago
[Jay-Z:]
 I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
 Real niggas just multiply
 And they say 21 I was supposed to die
 So I'm out here celebratin' my post demise
 If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival
 You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
 What up blood? What up cause?
 It's all black, I love us
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
[Jay-Z:]
 It's a celebration of black excellence
 Black tie, black Maybachs
 Black excellence, opulence, decadence
 Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
 I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
 In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb
 Do you know who I am Clarice?
 No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
 Success never smelled so sweet, I stink of success
 The new black elite They say my black card bear the mark of the beast
 I repeat, My religion is the beat
 My verse is like church, My Jesus piece Now please, domino, domino
 Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
 What's up to Will, Shoutout to O
 That ain't enough, We gon need a million more
 Kick in the door, Biggie flow
 I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
[Kanye West:]
 Yea it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
 So we won't take the time out til we reach the T O P
 From paroles to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
 We like the promised land of the OG's
 In the past if you picture events like a black tie
 What the last thing you expect to see, black guys
 What's the life expectancy for black guys?
 The system's working effectively, that's why
 I'll be a real man and take care of your son
 Every problem you had before this day is now done
 New crib, watch a movie
 Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
 Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
 Now ain't nothin new but your shoes
 Sunday morning, Praise the Lord
 You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
 So let's savor this moment, And take it to the floor
 Black excellence, Truly yours[Hook - Frank Ocean]

 I told my mama I was on the come up
 She said “you going to school I’ll give you a summer”
 Then she met NO ID and gave me his number
 10 years later she driving a Hummer
 N*ggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
 What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay
 And I’m rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
 I guess I’m getting high off my own supply
 Downtown mixing fabrics trying to find the magic
 Started a little blog just to get some traffic
 Old folks’ll tell you not to play in traffic
 A million hits and the web crashes – damn!
 South Park had ’em all laughing
 Now all my n*ggas designing and we all swaggin’
 Ignore the critics just to say we did it
 This ain’t no fashion show, motherf*cker, we live it

 I pledge allegiance, uh, to my Grandma
 For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
 Our apple pie was supplied through Arm & Hammer
 Straight out the kitchen, shh don’t wake Nana!
 Built a republic, that still stands
 I’m trying to lead a nation, to leave to my little man’s
 Or my daughter, so I’m boiling this water
 The scales was lopsided, I’m just restoring order
 Hold up, here comes grandma, what’s up YaYa?
 What’s that smell? Oh I’m just boiling some aqua
 No papa, bad Santa
 The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
 I got my liberty, chopping grams up
 Street justice, I pray God understand us
 I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers

[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 Oooooh
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z:]
 Picture if you will, that the throne was burning
 Rome was burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning
 Why does it always end up like this?
 Something that we don't determine
 Same people that I fought for
 That I fight for, that I ride for
 That I live for, that I die for
 Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
 And they want me dead
 But I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you
 But I can make em put their hands in the sky for you
 We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
 Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
 When the grief is over, beef is over, I'll be fly when Easter's over
 I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
 And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
 So the love is gone, Til blood is drawn
 So we no longer wear the same uniform
 Fuck you squares, The circle got smaller
 The castle got bigger, The walls got taller
 And truth be told after all that said
 Niggas still got love for you
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Showed love to you niggas
 You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
 I picked up the pieces, Before you swept on it
 God damn this shit leaves a mess don't it
 Shit feelin' like death don't it
 Charge it to the game, Whatever's left on it
 I spent about a minute, Maybe less on it
 Fly pelican fly, Turn the jets on it
 But first I shall digress on it
 Wasn't I a good king?
 (Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)
 Didn't I spoil you?, Me or the money, what you loyal to?
 (Huh, I gave you my loyalty)
 Made you Royalty and royalties
 (Took care of these niggas lawyer fees)
 And this is how niggas rewardin me
 (Damn)
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me
 But I'm bullet proof, bitch you can't get nothin' past me
 Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)
 And I'm bussin' back, So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones What do you do when the love turns the hate?
 (Gotta separate from these fuckin fakes)
 Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to exist
 So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
 Am I my brother's keeper?
 (Only if that nigga don't creep up)
 Got a pistol under my pillow
 (I've never been a deep sleeper)
 P-p-p-paranoia
 (Cause the nigga that said he'll...)
 Blast for ya (Is now...)
 Blastin for ya, That's an assassin for ya
 (These niggas got a shot they'll shoot)
 Please lord (Forgive him)
 For these niggas (Not know) What they, (Do) (Ooh)1985 white lamboghini Countach, 2 of em

But then I blessed them with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo, sponsored by Manolo

Yeah and I'm cold bitch, please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed
Take it how you want til a nigga dead
Til then I'm the illest motherfucker alive
Whole world aiming at a nigga head
Because I'm the illest motherfucker alive
King Hov, I'm exactly what the fuck you think
11 in a row, Bill Russell rings
Michael Jordan swag, y'all think Michael Jordan bad
Nigga I got 5 more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building now I'm on the Beatles ass
Niggas hear Watch the Throne, yeah it's like the Beatles back
Bey Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih Rih complete the family
Imagine how that's gon' look front row at the Grammys
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphy's couch
The Roc is in the building we should have stayed in the house
I don't even know what we doing here
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin' waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggas fashion is weak, they be wastin' all the models
Got the oversized Rollie let me show thee how to do it
When I say it then you see, it ain't only in the music
Basquiats, Warhols serving as my muses
My house like a museum so I see 'em when I'm peeing
Usually you have this much taste you European
That's the end of that way of thinking, nigga never again
Know when to leave when the heat is coming I learned that
This is where DeNiro would be if he ain't turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova this is real life
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like
I need a slow motion video right now
Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga

Niggas feel theyselves and then Watch The Throne drop
Niggas kill themselves what niggas gon' do Hov?

I'm in the two-door, true that, niggas tellin' me "You back?"
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life a bitch suck my dick huh?
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you muthafucker and I get it
No paper hoe but you can have some more of me
Or G, or are we speakin' methaphorically
Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam, nigga
Goin' HAM nigga, me and jigga
And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
And a few white girls, asses flat a shit

Got 'em jumpin' out the building
Watch out below, a million out the door
I'm about to go HAM, Hard As a Muthafucker
Let these niggas know who I am
I'm about to go HAM, Hard As a Muthafucker
Let these niggas know who I am

Y'all muthafuckers woulda been moved
I swam waters with great whites
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been chewed
I hustle with vultures late nights
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been food
Fuck wrong with these dudes
Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily like
These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like really half a billi nigga, really you got baby money
Keep it real with niggas, niggas ain't got my lady money
Watch the Throne don't step on our robe
Bad enough we let you step on our glow
When my nephew died, daddy dead
Niggas took the price on my uncles head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread
Bow down, brother pay homage
Don't spill hate all on my garments
Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh
Head shots nigga fuck your vests
Fuck the pig, no pork on my fork
Peace God, 'cause you know a nigga just went H.A.M.

 At 42 be better than 24, I carried the 4-5, mastered 48 laws
 Still wearing my 23's they can't fuck with the boy
 As far as them 16's, I'm 23 of it all
 Primetime, riding that 6 deuce
 That 9-11 I only subtract the roof
 Started in 88', Got warm in 92', I landed in 96'
 That's the year I came through
 I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
 Switched it for Ciroc to give Puff's stock a boost
 New money, I found the fountain of youth
 I'm headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontaine Bleu
 A case of Ace, make it 2, Nigga we rolling, beat the deuce
 The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do (ooh)
[Kanye West:]
 The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh
 The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do, huh
 The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh
 Primetime, basking in the lime
 Cassius in his prime, Coloring out of the line
 Cause they don't want nobody that's colored out of the lines
 So I'm late as a motherfucker, colored people time
 Damn Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
 Well, Adam gave up a rib so mine better be prime
 Niggas gon kill me, I swear they better be lying
 I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind
 Primetime, never hit these heights
 I mean it's like, it's like our first 1st class flight
 I'm trippin' on it, socks on marble floors
 I'm slippin' on it, Champagne, I'm sippin' on it
 Shit taste different, don't it?
 You know what, you right
 It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life
 "When you coming home" That's a text from my wife
 I told her, run a bubble bath
 And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
 And soak in that motherfucker til I call you back
 I mean who says shit like that, and doesn't laugh (un-huh)
 The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh
 The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do, huh
 The night is young, what you really wanna do, huhAdd a little sugar
(Ah, how)
Honey, suckle lamb
(Whoo)
A great big expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't miss
(Uh, huh)
With a dozen roses
(Eh, eh, eh, uh)
(Mr. West)
Such would astound you
(Pete Rock)
The joy of children laughing around you
(Uh)
These are the makings of you
(Whoo)
I do it for the forefathers, yeah, the street authors
That are not A&Rs in a cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls, that's way too fine for us to keep off us
(Ah, how)
Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake
She in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake
Now it's crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to come all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
'Cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood
Takin' refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that won't make it to the family will
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy, they don't know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty so it's not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had
Add a little sugar
(Whoo)
Honey suckle lamb
(C'mon)
A great big expression of happiness
(Ah, how)
Boy, you couldn't miss
(Uh, huh)
(Uh)
With a dozen roses
(Eh, eh, eh, uh)
(Kanye)
Such would astound you
(Pete Rock)
The joy of children laughing around you
(Uh)
These are the makings of you
(Yeah)
No electro, no metro, a little retro
Ah, perfecto
You know the demo, ya boy act wild
You ain't get the memo? Yeezy's back in style
Now when Rome got Gidget, the other got Bridget
What's more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters
Nah, you ain't listen, they black, they sistas
They momma named 'em after white bitches
So next time you see me on your Fallopian
Though the jewelry's Egyptian, know the hunger's Ethiopian
Stupid question's like, "Is he gon' be dope again?
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?"
This beat deserves Hennessey
And bad bitch, and a bag of weed, the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your life's cursed, well, mine's an obscenity
Add a little sugar
(Whoo)
Honey suckle lamb
(C'mon)
(Red lights)
A great big expression of happiness
(Ah, how)
Boy, you couldn't miss
(Uh, huh)
(Make that thing roll)
With a dozen roses
(Eh, eh, eh, uh)
(Kanye)
Such would astound you
(Pete Rock)
(Uh)
The joy of children laughing around you
(Uh)
These are the makings of you
(Yeah)
(Ah, how)
This is my momma shit
I used to hear this through the walls in the hood
When I was back on my pajama shit, Afros and marijuana sticks
Seeds and the ganjas had it poppin'
Like the sample that I'm rhymin' with, Pete Rock, let the needle drop
I seen so much as a kid, they surprised, I don't needle pop
Takin' sips of pop, six packs of millanips, Pink Champale
Ballentine L, Ballys on my feet help me balance out well
That and the shit, I used to balance on a scale
I got it honest from the parties from my momma's
Virgin Marys try to judge her, I'm like, "Where the Madonnas now?"
Give all glory to Gloria, they said
"You raised that boy too fast", but you was raising a warrior
We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us, uh
Keep your hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get mine up
Yeah
It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okayHuman beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the coliseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rollin' in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wonderin' if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here ballin', I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy, laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption
Coke on her black skin made a stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission'
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody wit'out tellin' me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun comin' up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinkin' 'bout the girl in all-leopard
Who was rubbin' the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by monogamy"
That's somethin' that the pastor don't preach
That's somethin' that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money we can't keep
But we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild[feat. Beyonce]

 He'll be nice to everyone, wherever we go

 So everybody know he love white people
 And I'll never let 'em leave his college girlfriend
 And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
 And I'll never let 'em ever hit the telethon
 I mean even if people dyin' and the world ends
 See, I just want 'I'm to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
 Just want 'I'm to be someone people like
 Don't want 'I'm to be hated, all the time judged
 Don't be like your daddy that would never budge
 And I'll never let 'I'm ever hit a strip club
 I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
 And I'll never let his mom move to L.A.

 Took me 26 years to find my path
 My only job is cuttin' the time in half
 So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
 Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
 Look a man dead in his eyes
 So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
 And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
 I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
 Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
 Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
 Never repeat him, never repeat him

 Welcome to the jungle
 Welcome to the jungle well [x2]
[Kanye West:]
 I asked her where she wanna be when she 25.
 She turned around and looked at me and said "alive"
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
[Jay-Z:]
 Black Axl Rose, Move halfs and wholes
 Come down to the jungle, Just ask for Hov
 Move blocks and squares, Move apples and pears
 Work pots and pans, Just to cop me some Airs
 My uncle died, My Daddy did too
 Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
 My nephew gone, My heart is torn
 Sometimes I look to the sky, Ask why I was born
 My faith in God, Every day is hard
 Every night is worse, That's why I pray so hard
[Kanye West:]
 Why I pray so hard, This is crazy God
 Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
 So que sera, Get a case of Syrah
 Let it chase the pain, Before it goes too far
[Jay-Z:]
 My dreams is big, Reality set in
 Let off a clip from a automatic weapon,
 Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
 Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it
 I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise
 Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
 I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin
 I ball at the mall, Beginning of the ending
 Where the fuck is the sun?
 It's been a while, Momma, look at ya son
 What happened to my smile?
 My tears is tatted My rag in my pocket
 I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it
 Champagne for the pain, Weed for the low
 God damn I'm so high, Where the fuck did I go?
 I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
 I look in the mirror, My only opponent
 Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?
 Either they know or don't care I'm fucking depressed
 No crying in public, Just lying to judges
 Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it well
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
 Goddammit!This is something like the Holocaust

 Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
 Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
 You just a commentator, If you getting paper
 Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
 In some relations, You just supposed to say none
 Heard she fucked the doorman
 Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
 Heard Yeezy was racist, Well, I guess that's on one basis
 I only like green faces
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord

 Beat the odds, Best the Feds
 It wouldn't be wise, To bet against the kid
 Start me broke, I bet I get rich
 Night shift, 6 to 6
 Gimmie one shot, One pot
 I'll show up in all white, Wearing no socks
 No ceiling, New coupe
 They know I'm a dope boy
 They don't have no proof
 I'm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
 It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
 I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
 I'm at the table, I'm gambling,
 Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
 I went through hell, I'm expecting heaven, I'm owed,
 I'm throwed And I stuck to the G-code,
 I'm here, Oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere,
 Ok here, Like a hare, Like a rabbit, I like karats
 I'm allergic to having bunny ears,
 Like broke, Like nope, Like ha,
 I ain't no joke, I can't be stopped
 Like nope, Like nope
 To the beat Noah...
 2 seats in the 911 No limit on the black card
 Told ya'll I was gonna go HAM, To the ocean was my backyard
 No lies in my verses, Please pardon all the curses
 Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
 Middle finger to my old life, Special shout out to my old head
 If it wasn't for your advice, A nigga would have been so dead
 I'm living life, Til these niggas kill me
 Turn this up, If these niggas feel me
 I'm riding dirty, Trying to get filthy
 Pabalo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
 Graduated to the MOMA
 And I did all of this, Without a diploma
 Graduated from the corner
 Ya'll can play me
 For a motherfuckin fool if you wanna,
 Street smart, And I'm book smart
 Could have been a chemist, Cause I cook smart
 Only thing that can stop me is me, And I'm a stop when the hook start
 Hold up
[Kanye West:]
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die, I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?

 Bloody Murder, murder murder [x4]
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
[Jay-Z:]
 This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
 Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
 Strays from the same shade, Ni**a we on the same team
 Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
 All black everything, Ni**a you know my fresh code
 I'm out here fightin' for you, Don't increase my stress load
 Ni**as watchin' the throne, Very happy to be
 Power to the people, When you see me, see you
[Kanye West:]
 And I'm from the murder capital, Where they murder for capital
 Heard about at least 3 killings this afternoon
 Lookin' at the news like damn I was just with him after school,
 No shop class but half the school got a tool,
 And I could die any day type attitude
 Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
 It's time for us to stop and re-define black power
 41 souls murdered in 50 hours
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder,
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
 Murder again...
 Is it genocide?
 Cause I can still hear his momma cry, Know the family traumatized
 Shots left holes in his face, Bout piranha-size
 The old pastor closed the cold casket
 And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
 It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
 I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
 314 soldiers died in Iraq
 509 died in Chicago
[Jay-Z:]
 I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
 Real niggas just multiply
 And they say 21 I was supposed to die
 So I'm out here celebratin' my post demise
 If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival
 You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
 What up blood? What up cause?
 It's all black, I love us
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
[Jay-Z:]
 It's a celebration of black excellence
 Black tie, black Maybachs
 Black excellence, opulence, decadence
 Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
 I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
 In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb
 Do you know who I am Clarice?
 No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
 Success never smelled so sweet, I stink of success
 The new black elite They say my black card bear the mark of the beast
 I repeat, My religion is the beat
 My verse is like church, My Jesus piece Now please, domino, domino
 Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
 What's up to Will, Shoutout to O
 That ain't enough, We gon need a million more
 Kick in the door, Biggie flow
 I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
[Kanye West:]
 Yea it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
 So we won't take the time out til we reach the T O P
 From paroles to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
 We like the promised land of the OG's
 In the past if you picture events like a black tie
 What the last thing you expect to see, black guys
 What's the life expectancy for black guys?
 The system's working effectively, that's why
 I'll be a real man and take care of your son
 Every problem you had before this day is now done
 New crib, watch a movie
 Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
 Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
 Now ain't nothin new but your shoes
 Sunday morning, Praise the Lord
 You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
 So let's savor this moment, And take it to the floor
 Black excellence, Truly yours[Hook - Frank Ocean]

 I told my mama I was on the come up
 She said “you going to school I’ll give you a summer”
 Then she met NO ID and gave me his number
 10 years later she driving a Hummer
 N*ggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
 What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay
 And I’m rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
 I guess I’m getting high off my own supply
 Downtown mixing fabrics trying to find the magic
 Started a little blog just to get some traffic
 Old folks’ll tell you not to play in traffic
 A million hits and the web crashes – damn!
 South Park had ’em all laughing
 Now all my n*ggas designing and we all swaggin’
 Ignore the critics just to say we did it
 This ain’t no fashion show, motherf*cker, we live it

 I pledge allegiance, uh, to my Grandma
 For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
 Our apple pie was supplied through Arm & Hammer
 Straight out the kitchen, shh don’t wake Nana!
 Built a republic, that still stands
 I’m trying to lead a nation, to leave to my little man’s
 Or my daughter, so I’m boiling this water
 The scales was lopsided, I’m just restoring order
 Hold up, here comes grandma, what’s up YaYa?
 What’s that smell? Oh I’m just boiling some aqua
 No papa, bad Santa
 The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
 I got my liberty, chopping grams up
 Street justice, I pray God understand us
 I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
 This is the Star Spangled Banner

[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 Oooooh
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z:]
 Picture if you will, that the throne was burning
 Rome was burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning
 Why does it always end up like this?
 Something that we don't determine
 Same people that I fought for
 That I fight for, that I ride for
 That I live for, that I die for
 Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
 And they want me dead
 But I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you
 But I can make em put their hands in the sky for you
 We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
 Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
 When the grief is over, beef is over, I'll be fly when Easter's over
 I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
 And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
 So the love is gone, Til blood is drawn
 So we no longer wear the same uniform
 Fuck you squares, The circle got smaller
 The castle got bigger, The walls got taller
 And truth be told after all that said
 Niggas still got love for you
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Showed love to you niggas
 You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
 I picked up the pieces, Before you swept on it
 God damn this shit leaves a mess don't it
 Shit feelin' like death don't it
 Charge it to the game, Whatever's left on it
 I spent about a minute, Maybe less on it
 Fly pelican fly, Turn the jets on it
 But first I shall digress on it
 Wasn't I a good king?
 (Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)
 Didn't I spoil you?, Me or the money, what you loyal to?
 (Huh, I gave you my loyalty)
 Made you Royalty and royalties
 (Took care of these niggas lawyer fees)
 And this is how niggas rewardin me
 (Damn)
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me
 But I'm bullet proof, bitch you can't get nothin' past me
 Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)
 And I'm bussin' back, So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones What do you do when the love turns the hate?
 (Gotta separate from these fuckin fakes)
 Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to exist
 So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
 Am I my brother's keeper?
 (Only if that nigga don't creep up)
 Got a pistol under my pillow
 (I've never been a deep sleeper)
 P-p-p-paranoia
 (Cause the nigga that said he'll...)
 Blast for ya (Is now...)
 Blastin for ya, That's an assassin for ya
 (These niggas got a shot they'll shoot)
 Please lord (Forgive him)
 For these niggas (Not know) What they, (Do) (Ooh)1985 white lamboghini Countach, 2 of em

Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga, hey, hey, hey

Ay, ay
Damn baby, pussy can't be your only hustle
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell
I mean a lot of niggas got money
So basically, Russell ain't the only Russell
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe
Zero, zero, zero, zero
A whole lot of O's
What you after, actor money?

And i swear the God they so cold
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes

She got her fur too, we got our his and her on
Don't look at the jewerly, or get your brrr on
Too close, you comatose so dope you overdose
Get back, you overclose
Oh no, the hood was strugglin'
But then I blessed them with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo, sponsored by Manolo
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos
Yeah and I'm cold bitch, please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed
Take it how you want til a nigga dead
Til then I'm the illest motherfucker alive
Whole world aiming at a nigga head
Because I'm the illest motherfucker alive
King Hov, I'm exactly what the fuck you think
11 in a row, Bill Russell rings
Michael Jordan swag, y'all think Michael Jordan bad
Nigga I got 5 more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building now I'm on the Beatles ass
Niggas hear Watch the Throne, yeah it's like the Beatles back
Bey Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih Rih complete the family
Imagine how that's gon' look front row at the Grammys
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphy's couch
The Roc is in the building we should have stayed in the house
I don't even know what we doing here
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin' waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggas fashion is weak, they be wastin' all the models
Got the oversized Rollie let me show thee how to do it
When I say it then you see, it ain't only in the music
Basquiats, Warhols serving as my muses
My house like a museum so I see 'em when I'm peeing
Usually you have this much taste you European
That's the end of that way of thinking, nigga never again
Know when to leave when the heat is coming I learned that
This is where DeNiro would be if he ain't turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova this is real life
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like
I need a slow motion video right now
Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga
hey, hey, hey
I need a slow motion video right now
ay, ay
I'm moving in slow motion, slow motionIt was all good just a week ago
Niggas feel theyselves and then Watch The Throne drop
Niggas kill themselves what niggas gon' do Hov?
This a new crack on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that, niggas tellin' me "You back?"
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life a bitch suck my dick huh?
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you muthafucker and I get it
No paper hoe but you can have some more of me
Or G, or are we speakin' methaphorically
Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam, nigga
Goin' HAM nigga, me and jigga
And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
And a few white girls, asses flat a shit
But the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit
Got 'em jumpin' out the building
Watch out below, a million out the door
I'm about to go HAM, Hard As a Muthafucker
Let these niggas know who I am
I'm about to go HAM, Hard As a Muthafucker
Let these niggas know who I am
Fuck y'all mad at me for?
You don't even know what I've been through
I play chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been moved
I swam waters with great whites
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been chewed
I hustle with vultures late nights
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been food
Fuck wrong with these dudes
Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily like
These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like really half a billi nigga, really you got baby money
Keep it real with niggas, niggas ain't got my lady money
Watch the Throne don't step on our robe
Bad enough we let you step on our glow
When my nephew died, daddy dead
Niggas took the price on my uncles head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread
Bow down, brother pay homage
Don't spill hate all on my garments
Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh
Head shots nigga fuck your vests
Fuck the pig, no pork on my fork
Peace God, 'cause you know a nigga just went H.A.M.
Hard As a muthafucker
Let these niggas know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM, Hard As a muthafucker
Let these niggas know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM*Deluxe Edition Bonus Tracks*

 That's what the fuck we on
 Mo' money, 40 year old phenom
 Our 15 minutes of fame has stretched beyond
 At 42 be better than 24, I carried the 4-5, mastered 48 laws
 Still wearing my 23's they can't fuck with the boy
 As far as them 16's, I'm 23 of it all
 Primetime, riding that 6 deuce
 That 9-11 I only subtract the roof
 Started in 88', Got warm in 92', I landed in 96'
 That's the year I came through
 I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
 Switched it for Ciroc to give Puff's stock a boost
 New money, I found the fountain of youth
 I'm headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontaine Bleu
 A case of Ace, make it 2, Nigga we rolling, beat the deuce
 The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do (ooh)
[Kanye West:]
 The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh
 The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do, huh
 The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh
 Primetime, basking in the lime
 Cassius in his prime, Coloring out of the line
 Cause they don't want nobody that's colored out of the lines
 So I'm late as a motherfucker, colored people time
 Damn Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
 Well, Adam gave up a rib so mine better be prime
 Niggas gon kill me, I swear they better be lying
 I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind
 Primetime, never hit these heights
 I mean it's like, it's like our first 1st class flight
 I'm trippin' on it, socks on marble floors
 I'm slippin' on it, Champagne, I'm sippin' on it
 Shit taste different, don't it?
 You know what, you right
 It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life
 "When you coming home" That's a text from my wife
 I told her, run a bubble bath
 And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
 And soak in that motherfucker til I call you back
 I mean who says shit like that, and doesn't laugh (un-huh)
 The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh
 The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do, huh
 The night is young, what you really wanna do, huhAdd a little sugar
(Ah, how)
Honey, suckle lamb
(Whoo)
A great big expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't miss
(Uh, huh)
With a dozen roses
(Eh, eh, eh, uh)
(Mr. West)
Such would astound you
(Pete Rock)
The joy of children laughing around you
(Uh)
These are the makings of you
(Whoo)
I do it for the forefathers, yeah, the street authors
That are not A&Rs in a cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls, that's way too fine for us to keep off us
(Ah, how)
Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake
She in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake
Now it's crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to come all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
'Cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood
Takin' refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that won't make it to the family will
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy, they don't know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty so it's not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had
Add a little sugar
(Whoo)
Honey suckle lamb
(C'mon)
A great big expression of happiness
(Ah, how)

(Yeah)
No electro, no metro, a little retro
Ah, perfecto
You know the demo, ya boy act wild
You ain't get the memo? Yeezy's back in style
Now when Rome got Gidget, the other got Bridget
What's more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters
Nah, you ain't listen, they black, they sistas
They momma named 'em after white bitches
So next time you see me on your Fallopian
Though the jewelry's Egyptian, know the hunger's Ethiopian
Stupid question's like, "Is he gon' be dope again?
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?"
This beat deserves Hennessey
And bad bitch, and a bag of weed, the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your life's cursed, well, mine's an obscenity
Add a little sugar
(Whoo)
Honey suckle lamb
(C'mon)

(Uh)

(Yeah)
(Ah, how)
This is my momma shit
I used to hear this through the walls in the hood
When I was back on my pajama shit, Afros and marijuana sticks
Seeds and the ganjas had it poppin'
Like the sample that I'm rhymin' with, Pete Rock, let the needle drop
I seen so much as a kid, they surprised, I don't needle pop
Takin' sips of pop, six packs of millanips, Pink Champale
Ballentine L, Ballys on my feet help me balance out well
That and the shit, I used to balance on a scale
I got it honest from the parties from my momma's
Virgin Marys try to judge her, I'm like, "Where the Madonnas now?"
Give all glory to Gloria, they said
"You raised that boy too fast", but you was raising a warrior
We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us, uh
Keep your hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire

What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the colloseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving, the sky's a feast
Rolling in the new rolls royce corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleahced
Drug dealer chic
Wonderin' if a dove's prayers reach
It's pious Pius, the God loves Pius
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
Or for Plato, the screech
I'm out chere ballin', I know you hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy he laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
You let me in to your encryption
Yeah, yeah
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that Jungle Fever
You will not the threesom
Just roll the weed up till I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never Fck no-one without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad, Real
Sun coming up 5AM
I Wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking about the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tatoos: One read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by Monogamy"
It's something the pastor don't preach
It's something the teacher can't teach
When we die, The money can't keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright

And I'll never let ‘em ever hit the telethon
I mean even if people dyin' and the world ends
See, I just want ‘im to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
Just want ‘im to be someone people like
Don't want ‘im to be hated, all the time judged
Don't be like your daddy that would never budge
And I'll never let ‘im ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
And I'll never let his mom move to L.A.
Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure, now we all pray
(Sun in the sky)
(You know how I feel)
(Breeze driftin' on by)
(Breeze driftin' on by)
(It's a new life for me)
Me and the RZA connect
(For me, for me)
Me and the RZA connect (Oooh, oooh)
(And I'm feelin' good)
Sorry junior, I already ruined ya
‘Cause you ain't even alive, paparazzi pursuin' ya
Sins of a father make yo' life ten times harder
I just wanna take ya to a barber
Bondin' on charters, all the shit that I never did
Teach ya good values, so you cherish it
Took me 26 years to find my path
My only job is cuttin' the time in half
So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
Never repeat him, never repeat him
(Sun in the sky)
(You know how I feel)
(Breeze driftin' on by)
(Breeze driftin' on by)
(It's a new life for me)
(For me, for me)
(Oooh, oooh)
(And I'm feelin' good)
(Sun in the sky, you know how I feel)
(Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel)
(Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel)
(It's a new life for me)
(It's a new dawn, it's a new day)
(It's a new life for me)
(Oooh, oooh)
(And I'm feelin'…)
(Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel)Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
I asked her where she wanna be when she 25
She turned around and looked at me and said "alive"
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
Black Axl Rose
Move halfs and wholes
Come down to the jungle
Just ask for Hov
Move blocks and squares
Move apples and pears
Work pots and pans
Just to cop me some Airs
My uncle died
My Daddy did too
Paralyzed by the pain
I can barely move
My nephew gone
My heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky
Ask why I was born
My faith in God
Every day is hard
Every night is worse
That's why I pray so hard
Why I pray so hard
This is crazy God
Just when I thought I had everything
I lost it all
So que sera
Get a case of Syrah
Let it chase the pain
Before it goes too far
My dreams is big
Reality set in
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon
Through shots in the door
It died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard
I knew it wouldn't make it
I'm a tortured soul
I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
I died in my sleep
I'm still Big Pimpin
I ball at the mall
Beginning of the ending
Where the fuck is the sun?
It's been a while
Momma, look at ya son
What happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted
My rag in my pocket
I'm just looking for love
I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain
Weed for the low
God damn I'm so high
Where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself
I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror
My only opponent
Where the fuck is the press?
Where the fuck is the Pres?
Either they know or don't care
I'm fucking depressed
No crying in public
Just lying to judges
Risking my life
I'm already dying, so fuck it well
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
Goddammit!This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars,
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Yeah, who gon' stop me?
No brakes, I need, State Farm
So many watches I need 8 arms
One neck but got 8 charms
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Niggas talkin', they bitch made, Ix-nay off my dicks-nay
That's pig Latin, itch-bay
Who gon' stop me huh?
Last night ain't go so well
Got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator, if you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, you just supposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that's on one basis
I only like green faces
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for
Y'all weed purple, my money purple
Y'all Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah circle
I wrote the verse, that I hope will hurt you
Who gone stop me huh?
Beat the odds, best the Feds
It wouldn't be wise, to bet against the kid
Start me broke, I bet I get rich
Night shift, 6 to 6
Gimmie one shot, one pot
I'll show up in all white, wearing no socks
No ceiling, new coupe
They know I'm a dope boy
They don't have no proof
I'm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
I'm at the table, I'm gambling,
Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
I went through hell, I'm expecting heaven, I'm owed,
I'm throwed and I stuck to the G-code,
I'm here, oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere,
OK here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats
I'm allergic to having bunny ears,
Like broke, like nope, like ha,
I ain't no joke, I can't be stopped
Like nope, like nope
Extend the beat Noah…
2 seats in the 911, no limit on the black card
Told y'all I was gonna go HAM, til' the ocean was my backyard
No lies in my verses, please pardon all the curses
Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
Middle finger to my old life, special shout out to my old head
If it wasn't for your advice, a nigga would have been so dead
I'm living life, til these niggas kill me
Turn this up, if these niggas feel me
I'm riding dirty, trying to get filthy
Pablo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
Graduated to the MOMA
And I did all of this, without a diploma
Graduated from the corner
Y'all can play me for a motherfuckin' fool if you wanna,
Street smart, and I'm book smart
Could have been a chemist, cause I cook smart
Only thing to stop me is me,
And I'ma stop when the start
Hold up
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the lord
Til I die, I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for
EndBloody murder, murder, murder
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
All-black everything, nigga you know my fresh code
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stressload!
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you
And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like "damn! I was just with him after school"
No shop class but half the school got a tool
And a "I could die any day"-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot repping his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine black power
41 souls murdered in fifty hours
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
Is it genocide?
Cause I can still hear his mama cry
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uh, real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21 I was supposed to die
So I'm out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You're gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? What up, cuz? It's all black, I love us
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
It's a celebration of black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast
I repeat: my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
What's up to Will? Shout out to O
That ain't enough. we gonna need a million more
"Kick in the door" Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
Yeah it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see, black guys?
What's the life expectancy for black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why!
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You're the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yours1985 white lamboghini Countach, 2 of em

Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo, sponsored by Manolo

Whole world aiming at a nigga head
Because I'm the illest motherfucker alive
King Hov, I'm exactly what the fuck you think

Nigga I got 5 more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building now I'm on the Beatles ass
Niggas hear Watch the Throne, yeah it's like the Beatles back

Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphy's couch
The Roc is in the building we should have stayed in the house
I don't even know what we doing here
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin' waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggas fashion is weak, they be wastin' all the models
Got the oversized Rollie let me show thee how to do it
When I say it then you see, it ain't only in the music
Basquiats, Warhols serving as my muses
My house like a museum so I see 'em when I'm peeing
Usually you have this much taste you European
That's the end of that way of thinking, nigga never again
Know when to leave when the heat is coming I learned that
This is where DeNiro would be if he ain't turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova this is real life
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like
I need a slow motion video right now
Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga

Still wearing my 23's they can't fk with the boy
As far as them 16's, I'm 23 of it all
Primetime, riding that 6 deuce
That 9-11 I only subtract the roof
Started in 88', Got warm in 92', I landed in 96'
That's the year I came through
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
Switched it for Ciroc to give Puff's stock a boost
New money, I found the fountain of youth
I'm headed to Miami to fk up the Fontaine Bleu
A case of Ace, make it 2, Nia we rolling, beat the deuce
The night is young, what the fk we gon' do (ooh)

Primetime, basking in the lime
Cassius in his prime, Coloring out of the line
Cause they don't want nobody that's colored out of the lines
So I'm late as a motherer, colored people time
Damn Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
Well, Adam gave up a rib so mine better be prime
Nias gon kill me, I swear they better be lying
I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind
Primetime, never hit these heights
I mean it's like, it's like our first 1st class flight
I'm trippin' on it, socks on marble floors
I'm slippin' on it, Champagne, I'm sippin' on it
Sh*t taste different, don't it?
You know what, you right
It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life
"When you coming home" That's a text from my wife
I told her, run a bubble bath
And float in that motherer like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherer til I call you back
I mean who says sh*t like that, and doesn't laugh (un-huh)

(baby, baby, baby)Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the colloseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving, the sky's a feast
Rolling in the new rolls royce corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleahced
Drug dealer chic
Wonderin' if a dove's prayers reach
It's pious Pius, the God loves Pius
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
Or for Plato, the screech
I'm out chere ballin', I know you hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy he laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
You let me in to your encryption
Yeah, yeah
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that Jungle Fever
You will not the threesom
Just roll the weed up till I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never Fck no-one without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad, Real
Sun coming up 5AM
I Wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking about the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tatoos: One read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by Monogamy"
It's something the pastor don't preach
It's something the teacher can't teach
When we die, The money can't keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

Paralyzed by the pain
I can barely move
My nephew gone
My heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky
Ask why I was born
My faith in God
Every day is hard
Every night is worse
That's why I pray so hard
Why I pray so hard
This is crazy God
Just when I thought I had everything
I lost it all
So que sera
Get a case of Syrah
Let it chase the pain
Before it goes too far
My dreams is big
Reality set in
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon
Through shots in the door
It died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard
I knew it wouldn't make it
I'm a tortured soul
I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
I died in my sleep
I'm still Big Pimpin
I ball at the mall
Beginning of the ending
Where the fuck is the sun?
It's been a while
Momma, look at ya son
What happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted
My rag in my pocket
I'm just looking for love
I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain
Weed for the low
God damn I'm so high
Where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself
I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror
My only opponent
Where the fuck is the press?
Where the fuck is the Pres?
Either they know or don't care
I'm fucking depressed
No crying in public
Just lying to judges
Risking my life
I'm already dying, so fuck it well
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
Goddammit!This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars,
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Yeah, who gon' stop me?
No brakes, I need, State Farm
So many watches I need 8 arms
One neck but got 8 charms
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Niggas talkin', they bitch made, Ix-nay off my dicks-nay
That's pig Latin, itch-bay
Who gon' stop me huh?
Last night ain't go so well
Got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator, if you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, you just supposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that's on one basis
I only like green faces
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for
Y'all weed purple, my money purple
Y'all Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah circle
I wrote the verse, that I hope will hurt you
Who gone stop me huh?
Beat the odds, best the Feds
It wouldn't be wise, to bet against the kid
Start me broke, I bet I get rich
Night shift, 6 to 6
Gimmie one shot, one pot
I'll show up in all white, wearing no socks
No ceiling, new coupe
They know I'm a dope boy
They don't have no proof
I'm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
I'm at the table, I'm gambling,
Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
I went through hell, I'm expecting heaven, I'm owed,
I'm throwed and I stuck to the G-code,
I'm here, oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere,
OK here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats
I'm allergic to having bunny ears,
Like broke, like nope, like ha,
I ain't no joke, I can't be stopped
Like nope, like nope
Extend the beat Noah…
2 seats in the 911, no limit on the black card
Told y'all I was gonna go HAM, til' the ocean was my backyard
No lies in my verses, please pardon all the curses
Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
Middle finger to my old life, special shout out to my old head
If it wasn't for your advice, a nigga would have been so dead
I'm living life, til these niggas kill me
Turn this up, if these niggas feel me
I'm riding dirty, trying to get filthy
Pablo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
Graduated to the MOMA
And I did all of this, without a diploma
Graduated from the corner
Y'all can play me for a motherfuckin' fool if you wanna,
Street smart, and I'm book smart
Could have been a chemist, cause I cook smart
Only thing to stop me is me,
And I'ma stop when the start
Hold up
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the lord
Til I die, I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for
EndBloody murder, murder, murder
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
All-black everything, nigga you know my fresh code
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stressload!
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you
And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like "damn! I was just with him after school"
No shop class but half the school got a tool
And a "I could die any day"-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot repping his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine black power
41 souls murdered in fifty hours
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
Is it genocide?
Cause I can still hear his mama cry
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uh, real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21 I was supposed to die
So I'm out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You're gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? What up, cuz? It's all black, I love us
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
It's a celebration of black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast
I repeat: my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
What's up to Will? Shout out to O
That ain't enough. we gonna need a million more
"Kick in the door" Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
Yeah it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see, black guys?
What's the life expectancy for black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why!
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You're the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yours1985 white lamboghini Countach, 2 of em
I need a slow motion video right now
Cause im movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga, hey, hey, hey

Ay, ay
Damn baby, pussy can't be your only hustle
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell

So basically, Russell ain't the only Russell
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe
Zero, zero, zero, zero
A whole lot of O's

She got her fur too, we got our his and her on
Don't look at the jewerly, or get your brrr on
Too close, you comatose so dope you overdose
Get back, you overclose
Oh no, the hood was strugglin'
But then I blessed them with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo, sponsored by Manolo
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos
Yeah and I'm cold bitch, please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed
Take it how you want til a nigga dead
Til then I'm the illest motherfucker alive
Whole world aiming at a nigga head
Because I'm the illest motherfucker alive
King Hov, I'm exactly what the fuck you think
11 in a row, Bill Russell rings
Michael Jordan swag, y'all think Michael Jordan bad
Nigga I got 5 more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building now I'm on the Beatles ass
Niggas hear Watch the Throne, yeah it's like the Beatles back
Bey Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih Rih complete the family
Imagine how that's gon' look front row at the Grammys
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphy's couch
The Roc is in the building we should have stayed in the house
I don't even know what we doing here
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin' waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggas fashion is weak, they be wastin' all the models
Got the oversized Rollie let me show thee how to do it
When I say it then you see, it ain't only in the music
Basquiats, Warhols serving as my muses
My house like a museum so I see 'em when I'm peeing
Usually you have this much taste you European
That's the end of that way of thinking, nigga never again
Know when to leave when the heat is coming I learned that
This is where DeNiro would be if he ain't turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova this is real life
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like
I need a slow motion video right now
Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga
hey, hey, hey
I need a slow motion video right now

Yeah, Primetime, Beat by Dion, Our third eon
That's what the fk we on
Mo' money, 40 year old phenom
Our 15 minutes of fame has stretched beyond
At 42 be better than 24, I carried the 4-5, mastered 48 laws
Still wearing my 23's they can't fk with the boy
As far as them 16's, I'm 23 of it all
Primetime, riding that 6 deuce
That 9-11 I only subtract the roof
Started in 88', Got warm in 92', I landed in 96'
That's the year I came through
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
Switched it for Ciroc to give Puff's stock a boost
New money, I found the fountain of youth
I'm headed to Miami to fk up the Fontaine Bleu
A case of Ace, make it 2, Nia we rolling, beat the deuce
The night is young, what the fk we gon' do (ooh)
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what the fk you wanna do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what the fk we gon' do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)
Primetime, basking in the lime
Cassius in his prime, Coloring out of the line
Cause they don't want nobody that's colored out of the lines
So I'm late as a motherer, colored people time
Damn Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
Well, Adam gave up a rib so mine better be prime
Nias gon kill me, I swear they better be lying
I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind
Primetime, never hit these heights
I mean it's like, it's like our first 1st class flight
I'm trippin' on it, socks on marble floors
I'm slippin' on it, Champagne, I'm sippin' on it
Sh*t taste different, don't it?
You know what, you right
It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life
"When you coming home" That's a text from my wife
I told her, run a bubble bath
And float in that motherer like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherer til I call you back
I mean who says sh*t like that, and doesn't laugh (un-huh)
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what the fk you wanna do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what the fk we gon' do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the coliseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rollin' in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wonderin' if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here ballin', I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy, laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption
Coke on her black skin made a stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission'
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody wit'out tellin' me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun comin' up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinkin' 'bout the girl in all-leopard
Who was rubbin' the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by monogamy"
That's somethin' that the pastor don't preach
That's somethin' that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money we can't keep
But we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild[feat. Beyonce]

 And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
 And I'll never let 'em ever hit the telethon
 I mean even if people dyin' and the world ends
 See, I just want 'I'm to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
 Just want 'I'm to be someone people like
 Don't want 'I'm to be hated, all the time judged
 Don't be like your daddy that would never budge
 And I'll never let 'I'm ever hit a strip club
 I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
 And I'll never let his mom move to L.A.

 'Cause you ain't even alive, paparazzi pursuin' ya
 Sins of a father make yo' life ten times harder
 I just wanna take ya to a barber
 Bondin' on charters, all the shit that I never did
 Teach ya good values, so you cherish it
 Took me 26 years to find my path
 My only job is cuttin' the time in half
 So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
 Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
 Look a man dead in his eyes
 So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
 And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
 I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
 Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
 Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
 Never repeat him, never repeat him
 (Sun in the sky)
 (You know how I feel)
 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (It's a new life for me)
 (For me, for me)
 (Oooh, oooh)
 (And I'm feelin' good)
 (Sun in the sky, you know how I feel)
 (Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel)
 (Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel)
 (It's a new life for me)
 (It's a new dawn, it's a new day)
 (It's a new life for me)
 (Oooh, oooh)
 (And I'm feelin'...)
 (Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel)[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle
 Welcome to the jungle well [x2]
[Kanye West:]
 I asked her where she wanna be when she 25.
 She turned around and looked at me and said "alive"
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
[Jay-Z:]
 Black Axl Rose, Move halfs and wholes
 Come down to the jungle, Just ask for Hov
 Move blocks and squares, Move apples and pears
 Work pots and pans, Just to cop me some Airs
 My uncle died, My Daddy did too
 Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
 My nephew gone, My heart is torn
 Sometimes I look to the sky, Ask why I was born
 My faith in God, Every day is hard
 Every night is worse, That's why I pray so hard
[Kanye West:]
 Why I pray so hard, This is crazy God
 Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
 So que sera, Get a case of Syrah
 Let it chase the pain, Before it goes too far
[Jay-Z:]
 My dreams is big, Reality set in
 Let off a clip from a automatic weapon,
 Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
 Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it
 I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise
 Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
 I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin
 I ball at the mall, Beginning of the ending
 Where the fuck is the sun?
 It's been a while, Momma, look at ya son
 What happened to my smile?
 My tears is tatted My rag in my pocket
 I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it
 Champagne for the pain, Weed for the low
 God damn I'm so high, Where the fuck did I go?
 I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
 I look in the mirror, My only opponent
 Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?
 Either they know or don't care I'm fucking depressed
 No crying in public, Just lying to judges
 Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it well
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
 Goddammit!This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars, Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for?
[Kanye West:]
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z & Kanye West:]
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Who gon stop me?
 No brakes, I need, State Farm
 So many watches I need 8 arms
 One neck but got 8 charms
[Jay-Z & Kanye West:]
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Kanye West:]
 Niggaas talkin, they bitch made, Ix-nay off my dicks-nay
 That's pig latin, itch-bay
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Last night ain't go so well
 Got kicked up out the hotel
 Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
 Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
 You just a commentator, If you getting paper
 Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
 In some relations, You just supposed to say none
 Heard she fucked the doorman
 Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
 Heard Yeezy was racist, Well, I guess that's on one basis
 I only like green faces
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars
 Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for
[Kanye West:]
 Ya'll weed purple, My money purple
 Ya'll Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah circle
 I wrote the verse, That I hope will hurt you
[Jay-Z:]
 Who gone stop me huh?
 Beat the odds, Best the Feds
 It wouldn't be wise, To bet against the kid
 Start me broke, I bet I get rich
 Night shift, 6 to 6
 Gimmie one shot, One pot
 I'll show up in all white, Wearing no socks
 No ceiling, New coupe
 They know I'm a dope boy
 They don't have no proof
 I'm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
 It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
 I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
 I'm at the table, I'm gambling,
 Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
 I went through hell, I'm expecting heaven, I'm owed,
 I'm throwed And I stuck to the G-code,
 I'm here, Oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere,
 Ok here, Like a hare, Like a rabbit, I like karats
 I'm allergic to having bunny ears,
 Like broke, Like nope, Like ha,
 I ain't no joke, I can't be stopped
 Like nope, Like nope
 To the beat Noah...
 2 seats in the 911 No limit on the black card
 Told ya'll I was gonna go HAM, To the ocean was my backyard
 No lies in my verses, Please pardon all the curses
 Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
 Middle finger to my old life, Special shout out to my old head
 If it wasn't for your advice, A nigga would have been so dead
 I'm living life, Til these niggas kill me
 Turn this up, If these niggas feel me
 I'm riding dirty, Trying to get filthy
 Pabalo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
 Graduated to the MOMA
 And I did all of this, Without a diploma
 Graduated from the corner
 Ya'll can play me
 For a motherfuckin fool if you wanna,
 Street smart, And I'm book smart
 Could have been a chemist, Cause I cook smart
 Only thing that can stop me is me, And I'm a stop when the hook start
 Hold up
[Kanye West:]
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die, I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars
 Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for[Jay-Z:]
 Bloody Murder, murder murder [x4]
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
[Jay-Z:]
 This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
 Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
 Strays from the same shade, Ni**a we on the same team
 Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
 All black everything, Ni**a you know my fresh code
 I'm out here fightin' for you, Don't increase my stress load
 Ni**as watchin' the throne, Very happy to be
 Power to the people, When you see me, see you
[Kanye West:]
 And I'm from the murder capital, Where they murder for capital
 Heard about at least 3 killings this afternoon
 Lookin' at the news like damn I was just with him after school,
 No shop class but half the school got a tool,
 And I could die any day type attitude
 Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
 It's time for us to stop and re-define black power
 41 souls murdered in 50 hours
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder,
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
 Murder again...
 Is it genocide?
 Cause I can still hear his momma cry, Know the family traumatized
 Shots left holes in his face, Bout piranha-size
 The old pastor closed the cold casket
 And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
 It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
 I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
 314 soldiers died in Iraq
 509 died in Chicago
[Jay-Z:]
 I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
 Real niggas just multiply
 And they say 21 I was supposed to die
 So I'm out here celebratin' my post demise
 If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival
 You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
 What up blood? What up cause?
 It's all black, I love us
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
[Jay-Z:]
 It's a celebration of black excellence
 Black tie, black Maybachs
 Black excellence, opulence, decadence
 Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
 I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
 In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb
 Do you know who I am Clarice?
 No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
 Success never smelled so sweet, I stink of success
 The new black elite They say my black card bear the mark of the beast
 I repeat, My religion is the beat
 My verse is like church, My Jesus piece Now please, domino, domino
 Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
 What's up to Will, Shoutout to O
 That ain't enough, We gon need a million more
 Kick in the door, Biggie flow
 I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
[Kanye West:]
 Yea it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
 So we won't take the time out til we reach the T O P
 From paroles to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
 We like the promised land of the OG's
 In the past if you picture events like a black tie
 What the last thing you expect to see, black guys
 What's the life expectancy for black guys?
 The system's working effectively, that's why
 I'll be a real man and take care of your son
 Every problem you had before this day is now done
 New crib, watch a movie
 Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
 Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
 Now ain't nothin new but your shoes
 Sunday morning, Praise the Lord
 You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
 So let's savor this moment, And take it to the floor
 Black excellence, Truly yours[Hook - Frank Ocean]

 [Verse 1 - Kanye West]
 I told my mama I was on the come up
 She said “you going to school I’ll give you a summer”
 Then she met NO ID and gave me his number
 10 years later she driving a Hummer
 N*ggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
 What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay
 And I’m rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
 I guess I’m getting high off my own supply
 Downtown mixing fabrics trying to find the magic
 Started a little blog just to get some traffic
 Old folks’ll tell you not to play in traffic
 A million hits and the web crashes – damn!
 South Park had ’em all laughing
 Now all my n*ggas designing and we all swaggin’
 Ignore the critics just to say we did it
 This ain’t no fashion show, motherf*cker, we live it

 [Verse 2 - Jay-Z]
 I pledge allegiance, uh, to my Grandma
 For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
 Our apple pie was supplied through Arm & Hammer
 Straight out the kitchen, shh don’t wake Nana!
 Built a republic, that still stands
 I’m trying to lead a nation, to leave to my little man’s
 Or my daughter, so I’m boiling this water
 The scales was lopsided, I’m just restoring order
 Hold up, here comes grandma, what’s up YaYa?
 What’s that smell? Oh I’m just boiling some aqua
 No papa, bad Santa
 The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
 I got my liberty, chopping grams up
 Street justice, I pray God understand us
 I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
 This is the Star Spangled Banner

[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 Oooooh
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z:]
 Picture if you will, that the throne was burning
 Rome was burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning
 Why does it always end up like this?
 Something that we don't determine
 Same people that I fought for
 That I fight for, that I ride for
 That I live for, that I die for
 Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
 And they want me dead
 But I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you
 But I can make em put their hands in the sky for you
 We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
 Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
 When the grief is over, beef is over, I'll be fly when Easter's over
 I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
 And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
 So the love is gone, Til blood is drawn
 So we no longer wear the same uniform
 Fuck you squares, The circle got smaller
 The castle got bigger, The walls got taller
 And truth be told after all that said
 Niggas still got love for you
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Showed love to you niggas
 You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
 I picked up the pieces, Before you swept on it
 God damn this shit leaves a mess don't it
 Shit feelin' like death don't it
 Charge it to the game, Whatever's left on it
 I spent about a minute, Maybe less on it
 Fly pelican fly, Turn the jets on it
 But first I shall digress on it
 Wasn't I a good king?
 (Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)
 Didn't I spoil you?, Me or the money, what you loyal to?
 (Huh, I gave you my loyalty)
 Made you Royalty and royalties
 (Took care of these niggas lawyer fees)
 And this is how niggas rewardin me
 (Damn)
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me
 But I'm bullet proof, bitch you can't get nothin' past me
 Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)
 And I'm bussin' back, So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones What do you do when the love turns the hate?
 (Gotta separate from these fuckin fakes)
 Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to exist
 So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
 Am I my brother's keeper?
 (Only if that nigga don't creep up)
 Got a pistol under my pillow
 (I've never been a deep sleeper)
 P-p-p-paranoia
 (Cause the nigga that said he'll...)
 Blast for ya (Is now...)
 Blastin for ya, That's an assassin for ya
 (These niggas got a shot they'll shoot)
 Please lord (Forgive him)
 For these niggas (Not know) What they, (Do) (Ooh)Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the coliseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rollin' in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wonderin' if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here ballin', I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy, laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption
Coke on her black skin made a stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission'
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody wit'out tellin' me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun comin' up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinkin' 'bout the girl in all-leopard
Who was rubbin' the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by monogamy"
That's somethin' that the pastor don't preach
That's somethin' that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money we can't keep
But we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild[feat. Beyonce]

Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
(Sounds so soulful, don't you agree?)
I invented swag, poppin bottles, putting supermodels in the cab
Proof, I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert: Hublots
Or the big face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes
Damn Yeezy and Hov, where the hell ya been?
Niggas talking real reckless; stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond them
Now I'm about to make them tuck their whole summer in
They say I'm crazy, but I'm about to go dumb again
They ain't seen me cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another 'gain
Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth
I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya
Flee in the G450 I might surface
Political refugee asylum can be purchased
Everything's for sale
I got 5 passports, I'm never going to jail
I made Jesus Walks, so I'm never going to hell
Couture level flow is never going on sale
Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive

 (Take 'em on home, take 'em on home...)
 (I got what you need, what, what you need)
 (Take 'em on home)
 (What you need, what, what you need)
 (I got what you need, what, what you need)
 (Take 'em on home, take 'em on home...)
 (Take 'em on home, take 'em on home...)
 (Tryna hurt my name, huh?)[Kanye West:]
 Yeah, uh
 (Sun in the sky)
 (You know how I feel)
 Me and the RZA connect
 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 Yeah, me and the RZA connect
 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (It's a new life for me)
 (For me, for me)
 (Oooh, oooh)
 (And I'm feelin' good)
 And I'll never let my son have an ego
 He'll be nice to everyone, wherever we go
 I mean, I might even make 'em be Republican
 So everybody know he love white people
 And I'll never let 'em leave his college girlfriend
 And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
 And I'll never let 'em ever hit the telethon
 I mean even if people dyin' and the world ends
 See, I just want 'I'm to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
 Just want 'I'm to be someone people like
 Don't want 'I'm to be hated, all the time judged
 Don't be like your daddy that would never budge
 And I'll never let 'I'm ever hit a strip club
 I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
 And I'll never let his mom move to L.A.
 Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure, now we all pray
 (Sun in the sky)
 (You know how I feel)
 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (It's a new life for me)
 Me and the RZA connect
 (For me, for me)
 Me and the RZA connect (Oooh, oooh)
 (And I'm feelin' good)
[Jay-Z:]
 Sorry junior, I already ruined ya
 'Cause you ain't even alive, paparazzi pursuin' ya
 Sins of a father make yo' life ten times harder
 I just wanna take ya to a barber
 Bondin' on charters, all the shit that I never did
 Teach ya good values, so you cherish it
 Took me 26 years to find my path
 My only job is cuttin' the time in half
 So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
 Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
 Look a man dead in his eyes
 So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
 And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
 I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
 Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
 Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
 Never repeat him, never repeat him
 (Sun in the sky)
 (You know how I feel)
 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (It's a new life for me)
 (For me, for me)
 (Oooh, oooh)
 (And I'm feelin' good)
 (Sun in the sky, you know how I feel)
 (Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel)
 (Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel)
 (It's a new life for me)
 (It's a new dawn, it's a new day)
 (It's a new life for me)
 (Oooh, oooh)
 (And I'm feelin'...)
 (Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel)[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle
 Welcome to the jungle well [x2]
[Kanye West:]
 I asked her where she wanna be when she 25.
 She turned around and looked at me and said "alive"
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
[Jay-Z:]
 Black Axl Rose, Move halfs and wholes
 Come down to the jungle, Just ask for Hov
 Move blocks and squares, Move apples and pears
 Work pots and pans, Just to cop me some Airs
 My uncle died, My Daddy did too
 Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
 My nephew gone, My heart is torn
 Sometimes I look to the sky, Ask why I was born
 My faith in God, Every day is hard
 Every night is worse, That's why I pray so hard
[Kanye West:]
 Why I pray so hard, This is crazy God
 Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
 So que sera, Get a case of Syrah
 Let it chase the pain, Before it goes too far
[Jay-Z:]
 My dreams is big, Reality set in
 Let off a clip from a automatic weapon,
 Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
 Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it
 I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise
 Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
 I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin
 I ball at the mall, Beginning of the ending
 Where the fuck is the sun?
 It's been a while, Momma, look at ya son
 What happened to my smile?
 My tears is tatted My rag in my pocket
 I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it
 Champagne for the pain, Weed for the low
 God damn I'm so high, Where the fuck did I go?
 I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
 I look in the mirror, My only opponent
 Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?
 Either they know or don't care I'm fucking depressed
 No crying in public, Just lying to judges
 Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it well
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
 Goddammit!This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars, Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for?
[Kanye West:]
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z & Kanye West:]
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Who gon stop me?
 No brakes, I need, State Farm
 So many watches I need 8 arms
 One neck but got 8 charms
[Jay-Z & Kanye West:]
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Kanye West:]
 Niggaas talkin, they bitch made, Ix-nay off my dicks-nay
 That's pig latin, itch-bay
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Last night ain't go so well
 Got kicked up out the hotel
 Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
 Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
 You just a commentator, If you getting paper
 Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
 In some relations, You just supposed to say none
 Heard she fucked the doorman
 Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
 Heard Yeezy was racist, Well, I guess that's on one basis
 I only like green faces
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars
 Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for
[Kanye West:]
 Ya'll weed purple, My money purple
 Ya'll Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah circle
 I wrote the verse, That I hope will hurt you
[Jay-Z:]
 Who gone stop me huh?
 Beat the odds, Best the Feds
 It wouldn't be wise, To bet against the kid
 Start me broke, I bet I get rich
 Night shift, 6 to 6
 Gimmie one shot, One pot
 I'll show up in all white, Wearing no socks
 No ceiling, New coupe
 They know I'm a dope boy
 They don't have no proof
 I'm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
 It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
 I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
 I'm at the table, I'm gambling,
 Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
 I went through hell, I'm expecting heaven, I'm owed,
 I'm throwed And I stuck to the G-code,
 I'm here, Oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere,
 Ok here, Like a hare, Like a rabbit, I like karats
 I'm allergic to having bunny ears,
 Like broke, Like nope, Like ha,
 I ain't no joke, I can't be stopped
 Like nope, Like nope
 To the beat Noah...
 2 seats in the 911 No limit on the black card
 Told ya'll I was gonna go HAM, To the ocean was my backyard
 No lies in my verses, Please pardon all the curses
 Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
 Middle finger to my old life, Special shout out to my old head
 If it wasn't for your advice, A nigga would have been so dead
 I'm living life, Til these niggas kill me
 Turn this up, If these niggas feel me
 I'm riding dirty, Trying to get filthy
 Pabalo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
 Graduated to the MOMA
 And I did all of this, Without a diploma
 Graduated from the corner
 Ya'll can play me
 For a motherfuckin fool if you wanna,
 Street smart, And I'm book smart
 Could have been a chemist, Cause I cook smart
 Only thing that can stop me is me, And I'm a stop when the hook start
 Hold up
[Kanye West:]
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die, I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars
 Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for[Jay-Z:]
 Bloody Murder, murder murder [x4]
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
[Jay-Z:]
 This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
 Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
 Strays from the same shade, Ni**a we on the same team
 Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
 All black everything, Ni**a you know my fresh code
 I'm out here fightin' for you, Don't increase my stress load
 Ni**as watchin' the throne, Very happy to be
 Power to the people, When you see me, see you
[Kanye West:]
 And I'm from the murder capital, Where they murder for capital
 Heard about at least 3 killings this afternoon
 Lookin' at the news like damn I was just with him after school,
 No shop class but half the school got a tool,
 And I could die any day type attitude
 Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
 It's time for us to stop and re-define black power
 41 souls murdered in 50 hours
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder,
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
 Murder again...
 Is it genocide?
 Cause I can still hear his momma cry, Know the family traumatized
 Shots left holes in his face, Bout piranha-size
 The old pastor closed the cold casket
 And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
 It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
 I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
 314 soldiers died in Iraq
 509 died in Chicago
[Jay-Z:]
 I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
 Real niggas just multiply
 And they say 21 I was supposed to die
 So I'm out here celebratin' my post demise
 If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival
 You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
 What up blood? What up cause?
 It's all black, I love us
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
[Jay-Z:]
 It's a celebration of black excellence
 Black tie, black Maybachs
 Black excellence, opulence, decadence
 Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
 I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
 In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb
 Do you know who I am Clarice?
 No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
 Success never smelled so sweet, I stink of success
 The new black elite They say my black card bear the mark of the beast
 I repeat, My religion is the beat
 My verse is like church, My Jesus piece Now please, domino, domino
 Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
 What's up to Will, Shoutout to O
 That ain't enough, We gon need a million more
 Kick in the door, Biggie flow
 I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
[Kanye West:]
 Yea it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
 So we won't take the time out til we reach the T O P
 From paroles to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
 We like the promised land of the OG's
 In the past if you picture events like a black tie
 What the last thing you expect to see, black guys
 What's the life expectancy for black guys?
 The system's working effectively, that's why
 I'll be a real man and take care of your son
 Every problem you had before this day is now done
 New crib, watch a movie
 Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
 Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
 Now ain't nothin new but your shoes
 Sunday morning, Praise the Lord
 You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
 So let's savor this moment, And take it to the floor
 Black excellence, Truly yours[Hook - Frank Ocean]

 [Verse 1 - Kanye West]
 I told my mama I was on the come up
 She said “you going to school I’ll give you a summer”
 Then she met NO ID and gave me his number
 10 years later she driving a Hummer
 N*ggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
 What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay
 And I’m rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
 I guess I’m getting high off my own supply
 Downtown mixing fabrics trying to find the magic
 Started a little blog just to get some traffic
 Old folks’ll tell you not to play in traffic
 A million hits and the web crashes – damn!
 South Park had ’em all laughing
 Now all my n*ggas designing and we all swaggin’
 Ignore the critics just to say we did it
 This ain’t no fashion show, motherf*cker, we live it

 I pledge allegiance, uh, to my Grandma
 For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
 Our apple pie was supplied through Arm & Hammer
 Straight out the kitchen, shh don’t wake Nana!
 Built a republic, that still stands
 I’m trying to lead a nation, to leave to my little man’s
 Or my daughter, so I’m boiling this water
 The scales was lopsided, I’m just restoring order
 Hold up, here comes grandma, what’s up YaYa?
 What’s that smell? Oh I’m just boiling some aqua
 No papa, bad Santa
 The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
 I got my liberty, chopping grams up
 Street justice, I pray God understand us
 I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
 This is the Star Spangled Banner

[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 Oooooh
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z:]
 Picture if you will, that the throne was burning
 Rome was burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning
 Why does it always end up like this?
 Something that we don't determine
 Same people that I fought for
 That I fight for, that I ride for
 That I live for, that I die for
 Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
 And they want me dead
 But I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you
 But I can make em put their hands in the sky for you
 We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
 Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
 When the grief is over, beef is over, I'll be fly when Easter's over
 I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
 And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
 So the love is gone, Til blood is drawn
 So we no longer wear the same uniform
 Fuck you squares, The circle got smaller
 The castle got bigger, The walls got taller
 And truth be told after all that said
 Niggas still got love for you
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Showed love to you niggas
 You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
 I picked up the pieces, Before you swept on it
 God damn this shit leaves a mess don't it
 Shit feelin' like death don't it
 Charge it to the game, Whatever's left on it
 I spent about a minute, Maybe less on it
 Fly pelican fly, Turn the jets on it
 But first I shall digress on it
 Wasn't I a good king?
 (Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)
 Didn't I spoil you?, Me or the money, what you loyal to?
 (Huh, I gave you my loyalty)
 Made you Royalty and royalties
 (Took care of these niggas lawyer fees)
 And this is how niggas rewardin me
 (Damn)
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me
 But I'm bullet proof, bitch you can't get nothin' past me
 Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)
 And I'm bussin' back, So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones What do you do when the love turns the hate?
 (Gotta separate from these fuckin fakes)
 Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to exist
 So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
 Am I my brother's keeper?
 (Only if that nigga don't creep up)
 Got a pistol under my pillow
 (I've never been a deep sleeper)
 P-p-p-paranoia
 (Cause the nigga that said he'll...)
 Blast for ya (Is now...)
 Blastin for ya, That's an assassin for ya
 (These niggas got a shot they'll shoot)
 Please lord (Forgive him)
 For these niggas (Not know) What they, (Do) (Ooh)Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the colloseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving, the sky's a feast
Rolling in the new rolls royce corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleahced
Drug dealer chic
Wonderin' if a dove's prayers reach
It's pious Pius, the God loves Pius
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
Or for Plato, the screech
I'm out chere ballin', I know you hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy he laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
You let me in to your encryption
Yeah, yeah
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that Jungle Fever
You will not the threesom
Just roll the weed up till I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never Fck no-one without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad, Real
Sun coming up 5AM
I Wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking about the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tatoos: One read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by Monogamy"
It's something the pastor don't preach
It's something the teacher can't teach
When we die, The money can't keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

Took me 26 years to find my path
My only job is cuttin' the time in half
So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'

Black Axl Rose
Move halfs and wholes
Come down to the jungle
Just ask for Hov
Move blocks and squares
Move apples and pears
Work pots and pans
Just to cop me some Airs
My uncle died
My Daddy did too
Paralyzed by the pain
I can barely move
My nephew gone
My heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky
Ask why I was born
My faith in God
Every day is hard
Every night is worse
That's why I pray so hard
Why I pray so hard
This is crazy God
Just when I thought I had everything
I lost it all
So que sera
Get a case of Syrah
Let it chase the pain
Before it goes too far
My dreams is big
Reality set in
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon
Through shots in the door
It died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard
I knew it wouldn't make it
I'm a tortured soul
I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
I died in my sleep
I'm still Big Pimpin
I ball at the mall
Beginning of the ending
Where the fuck is the sun?
It's been a while
Momma, look at ya son
What happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted
My rag in my pocket
I'm just looking for love
I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain
Weed for the low
God damn I'm so high
Where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself
I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror
My only opponent
Where the fuck is the press?
Where the fuck is the Pres?
Either they know or don't care
I'm fucking depressed
No crying in public
Just lying to judges
Risking my life
I'm already dying, so fuck it well
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
Goddammit!This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?

Yes! Tell Howard Cosell

Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, you just supposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that's on one basis
I only like green faces
This is something like the Holocaust

No ceiling, new coupe
They know I'm a dope boy

Middle finger to my old life, special shout out to my old head
If it wasn't for your advice, a nigga would have been so dead

EndBloody murder, murder, murder
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
All-black everything, nigga you know my fresh code
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stressload!
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you
And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like "damn! I was just with him after school"
No shop class but half the school got a tool
And a "I could die any day"-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot repping his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine black power
41 souls murdered in fifty hours
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
Is it genocide?
Cause I can still hear his mama cry
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uh, real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21 I was supposed to die
So I'm out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You're gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? What up, cuz? It's all black, I love us
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
It's a celebration of black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast
I repeat: my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
What's up to Will? Shout out to O
That ain't enough. we gonna need a million more
"Kick in the door" Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
Yeah it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see, black guys?
What's the life expectancy for black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why!
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You're the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yoursHuman beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the colloseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving, the sky's a feast
Rolling in the new rolls royce corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleahced
Drug dealer chic
Wonderin' if a dove's prayers reach
It's pious Pius, the God loves Pius
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
Or for Plato, the screech
I'm out chere ballin', I know you hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy he laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
You let me in to your encryption
Yeah, yeah
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that Jungle Fever
You will not the threesom
Just roll the weed up till I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never Fck no-one without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad, Real
Sun coming up 5AM
I Wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking about the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tatoos: One read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by Monogamy"
It's something the pastor don't preach
It's something the teacher can't teach
When we die, The money can't keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

Took me 26 years to find my path
My only job is cuttin' the time in half
So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
Never repeat him, never repeat him

It's a celebration of black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast
I repeat: my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
What's up to Will? Shout out to O
That ain't enough. we gonna need a million more
"Kick in the door" Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
Yeah it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see, black guys?
What's the life expectancy for black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why!
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You're the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yoursYou might think you've peeked the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
It may just sound all whack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted fiction, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children, zip it, listen
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You ain't got no fucking Yeezy in Serrato?
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a nice flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the king of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air rolling down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why you're Winslow
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines
And then they make noise
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
I saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohAin't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Is hip hop, just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo's smilin' they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off a this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it!
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said "take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a crip said: "I got way too many blues for any more bad news"
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
And end all of that wack shit
Act like I aint had a belt in two classes
I aint got it I'm going after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever who has it
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, its like that ya'll
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about 2 things, my black balls
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I know cops, hems is lifting lenses
Kid, Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes
Throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
Got made code red
Break up the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying
You give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, downI'm living' in that 21st century
Doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking', I just count the hours
Stop tripping', I'm tripping' off the power
(21st century schizoid man)
The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We ain't got nothing' to lose, ma' fucka', we rolling
Huh? Ma'fucka', we rolling'
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man's world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'
Huh? I see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm trippin' off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And then they (hey) and then they
And then they (hey) and then they
And then they (hey) and then they
(21st century schizoid man)
Fuck S-N-L and the whole cast
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my ass-hole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goldies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he so, fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin' up with me
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for its custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece
Thinkin', no one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And then they (hey) and then they
And then they (hey) and then they
And then they (hey) and then they
(21st century schizoid man)
Colin, Powers, Austin, Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say "How was the abomination of Obama's nation?"
Well that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of day, goddammit I'm killin' this shit
I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How 'Ye doin? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'
I got the power, make yo' life so exciting (so exciting)
Now this would be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window
Letting everything go
Letting everything go
Now this would be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window
Letting everything go
Letting everything go
Now this would be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window
Letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?
(21st century schizoid man)[Instrumental]Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything, want you to see all of the lights
Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, all of the lights
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
All of the lights
If you want it you can get it
For the rest of your life
If you want it you can get it
For the rest of your life
Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm headed home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, headed up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take 'em to that ghetto university
All of the lights, cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, streetlights, all of the lights
All of the lights, fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life, every night, all of the lights
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything, want you to see all of the lights
Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts suck me dry, I spent that bread
She need a daddy , baby please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university
All of the lights, cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, streetlights, all of the lights
All of the lights, fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life, every night, all of the lights
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything, want you to see all of the lights
Getting mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Get it right, hey
You should go and get your own
Getting mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Get it right, hey
You should go and get your own
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
Okay, okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We're going all the way this time
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything, want you to see all of the lights
I tried to tell you but all I could say is, oh
I tried to tell you but all I could say is, oh
I tried to tell you but all I could say is, oh
I tried to tell you but all I could say is, oh, ohI shoot the lights out
Until it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood sucker
Fat motherfucker, now looks who's in trouble
As you run through my jungle all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands
The best living or dead, hands down, huh?
Less talk, more head right now, huh?
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And about to take it to another level, bitch
None of who you goin' get, ain't nobody as cold as this
Do the rap and attract triple double no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same rap's will the track, man
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act
And short nigga but these ho's love my accent
She came up to me and said this the number two gal
If you want to make it number one, you're number two now
This the Goose and Malibu, I call it MaliBOO-YAH
God damn Yeezy, how you gonna hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well, what you gonna do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Not gonna do us, it's new now
Think you motherfucker really, really  need to cool out
'Cause you will never get on top of this
So mami best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claimin' that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just want to swallow shit
I'm livin' in the future so the presence is my past
My presence is the present, kiss my ass
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscious
Question: what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conga, stomp, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear things scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles
I kill a block, I murder the avenues
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get are these vampires and blood suckers
All I see are these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelin's in the air
All I see are these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryin' to draw blood from my ice cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards off
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands
Pull up in a monster automobile gangster
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You can be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first thing's first: I'll eat your brains
Then I'mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
He a dresser from Milan that's the monster do
Monster Giuseppie heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the Rasta and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with a funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my show's ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it
Hotter than a Middle-Eastern climate, violent
Twenty matahran, go teewyin' it, wile it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
'Cause all these niggas so one-track minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki sh-she escaped
She on a diet, but her cock is eating cheesecake
And I'll say "Bride of Chuckie" is child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Jay should menage Friday
Pink wig, dick, ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I, I crossed the line, line
And I'll, I'll let God decide-cide
I, I wouldn't last these shoulders
So I, I am headed home, home
I, I crossed the line, line
And I'll, I'll let God decide-cide
I, I wouldn't last these shoulders
So I, I am headed home, home
I, I crossed the line, line
And I'll, I'll let God decide-cide
I, I wouldn't last these shoulders
So I, I am headed home, homeOne hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all love us, I need more rubbers
And If I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time, let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Will be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, ta-dah
Address me as your highness, high as United
Thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man they outta work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I rather spit something that gotta purp'
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fuckin' beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have installed
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die, you be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossa's
The Hammer went and broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil' so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike hammer thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning their little bridges, fucking ridiculous
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil' in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I've become
CNN said I'll be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
You looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with mother goose
Them ho's coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too it don't effect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilo's came we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yeah
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If god had a iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazing, the faces and places, the favorite
My cup overruneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn it's hard not for me to waste it
The new commandment: thou should not hate, kid
My movement is like the Civil Rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothin' like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April so she chose to march
Damn, another broken heart
I keep bitches by the two's nigga, Noah's ark
I got a seven on me, I call my dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
G-A-T in the path finder
'Cause you haters got PhD's
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron
Hey yo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Cars for the misses and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculousI love it though
I love it though
You know
Put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waitin'
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
May the Lord forgive us, may the God's be with us
And that magic hour I seen good Christians make rash decisions
Oh she do it, what happened to religion?
Oh she lose it, she putting on her make up
She casually allure, text message break up, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the ass hole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the Lebron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stuntin' on a Jumbotron
I'm lookin' at her like, "This what you really want it, huh?"
What we argue anyway, oh, I forgot it's summertime
Put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan
Satan, Satan, Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waitin'
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
When the sun go down it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that are still up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standin' there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot at the bar, take a seat
I ordered you jerk, she said, "You are what you eat"
You see I always loved your sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme
That's Dior Homme not Dior homie
The crib scarface couldn't be more Tony
You love me for me, could you be more phony?
Put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evenin'
Cat got your tongue?
Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sippin' RosÃ© all along
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbin' up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin' runnin' signs like they don't matter
Hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes Sedan, they'll export
So many cars DMV though it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns
I shed a tear before the nights over
God bless the man I put this ice over
Gettin' 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings never stumble retracin' my stepsAnd I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
She find pictures in my email
I sent this girl a picture of my dick.
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good with that shit.
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at
See, I always find
And I always find
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs

Run away
Run away from me, baby
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearin' knockoffs, huh?
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Fools like vultures wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in a baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!
Never was much of a romantic,
I could never take the intimacy.
And I know I did damage,
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me,
I guess you've got another advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything.
And I don't know how I'm a manage,
If one day you just up and leave
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you canI think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Bittersweet taste made his gold tooth ache, uh
Make a knee shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun come, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin' life like we won a sweepstakes, what?
We headed to hell for heaven's sakes, huh?
Well, I'ma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we've crossed the line
No more drugs for me
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and
Baby, we'll live a hell of a life
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You can hear the loudest screams
Comin' from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gang bang
It's kinda crazy, that's opposite of the same thing
Well, I guess a lot of niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains, we all in the same game
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we've crossed the line
No more drugs for me
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and
Baby, we'll live a hell of a life
One day I'm gon' marry a porn star
We'll have a big-ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaid
She wanna role play 'til I roll over
I'ma need a whole day, at least roll dolja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day?
Especially if she can't get that dress on Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her get away
How could you say they live they life wrong
When you never fuck wit' the lights on?
Fuck with the lights, fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights, fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights on with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights, fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights, fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights, fuck with the, with the lights on
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we've crossed the line
No more drugs for me
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and
Baby, we'll live a hell of a life
I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in the bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a lifeWhose fault?
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
On a bathroom wall I wrote
I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else
I took a piss and dismiss it, like fuck it
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing or harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
'TIl about two am and I call back and I hang up
And I start to blame myself, somebody help
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking, and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't fixin' to see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other nigga's stroking you
Lie and say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone, like what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money, that ain't right, girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy, I ain't your right, girl
You'll probably find one of them "I like art" type girls
All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with a lie
Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity, we erased one another
So far from where we came with so much of everything
How do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy
Equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Chloe Mitchell
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just rang and rang
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing
Oh, my God, baby, you done took this shit to the 'nother motherfucking level
Now a neighborhood nigga like me
Ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this
God damn, god damn
Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga? Yeezy taught me
You never used to talk dirty, but now you, you god damn disgusting
My, my God, wh-wh-where'd you learn that? Yeezy taught me
Look at you motherfucking butt-ass naked
With them motherfucking Jimmy Choo's on
Who thought you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choo's on?
Yeezy taught me
Yo, you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level
This is some Cirque Du Soleil pussy now, shit
You done went all porno on a nigga, okay?
And I, I, I, I love it, and I thank you
I thank you, my dick thanks you
How did you learn, how di-
How did your pussy game come up?
Yeezy taught me
I was fucking parts of your pussy
I never fucked before
I was in there like, "Oh shit I never been here before
I've never even seen this part of Pussy Town before"
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit
What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
And when I see that nigga I'ma thank him
I'ma buy the album, I'ma download that motherfucker
I'ma shoot a bootlegger, that's how good I feel about this nigga
Oh, I still can't believe you got me this watch
This motherfucker's the exact motherfucker I wanted
With the bezel, this is the motherfucker I wanted
I saw this shit, I saw it
Twista had this shit on in The Source, I remember
Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source
That's right, that's right
Yo, yo, babe, yo, yo, this is the best birthday ever
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?
Yeezy taught me
Yeezy taught you well
Yeezy taught you wellI'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
Down the time
I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a city
And I'm down for the night, down for the night
Says she's down for the night
I'm never alone
Down the time
I'm lost in the world
I'm down my whole life
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night
You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Mama say, mama say, mama Maku-san
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake-ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid in that afterlife
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid, yeah
I'm up in the woods
  (Run from the lights, run from the night)
I'm down on my mind
  (Run for your life)
I'm new in the city
  (Down for the night, down for the night)
Down for the night
I'm lost in the world
I'm down my whole life
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
I'm lost in the world
I'm down my whole life
I'm new in the city
Down for the night, down for the night
I'm lost in the world
I'm down my whole life
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the nightUs living as we do upside-down
And the new words at hand is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preachers spill or squeal
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly peaked
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up
Woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped from bed
And we have not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed
Across our authentic vagina
We learned to our amazement
The untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in a rusty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, freedom
Democracy, liberty and justice
Were revolutionary code names
That proceeded the bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife and a children
And some food to feed them every night
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addictions
Well, gather ‘round children, zip it, listen:
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high

I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
"You ain't got no (EXPLICIT) Yeezy in your Serato?"
(You ain't got no Yeezy,?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town (EXPLICIT) with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much (EXPLICIT), I woke up in Sleepy Hollow
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(I saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh

Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohAin't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my (EXPLICIT) get it, get it?
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a (EXPLICIT) ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this (EXPLICIT)
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest (EXPLICIT), I must have missed it!
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said "take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip said, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a (EXPLICIT) roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in (EXPLICIT) coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my (EXPLICIT), x and o
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack (EXPLICIT)
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, it's like that y'all
I don't really give a (EXPLICIT) about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black (EXPLICIT)
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, (EXPLICIT)
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
(EXPLICIT) hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, downLetra - Power - Kanye West
Im livin in the 21st century
Doin something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin, I just count the hours
Stop trippin, Im trippin off the power
(21st century schizoid man)
The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We aint got nothin to lose, maf-cka, we rollin
Huh? Maf-cka, we rollin
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white mans world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin
Huh? I see you in the mornin
This is way too much, I need a moment
No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin, I just count the hours
Stop trippin, Im trippin off the power

More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
Im an asshole? You n-ggas gotÂ jokes
You short-minded n-ggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He know, he so, f-ckin gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being prodded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin up with me
Takin my inner child, Im fighting for it, custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece
N-gga, no one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin, I just count the hours
Stop trippin, Im trippin off the power
Til then, f-ck that, the Worlds ours

Honeymoon on the dance floor

That's one hell of a lifeUs living as we do upside down.
And the new word to have is revolution.
People don't even want to hear the preacher
spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued.
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey.
The youngsters who were programmed to continue
fucking up woke up one night digging
Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys.
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes.
The signs of Truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina.
We learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal.
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault,
hosed down daily with a gagging perfume.
America was a bastard the illegitimate daughter of the mother country
whose legs were then spread around the world
and a rapist known as freedom, free doom.
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names
that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
in the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
and a children and some food to feed them every night.
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you.
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addictions
Well, gather ‘round children, zip it, listen:

Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
"You ain't got no (EXPLICIT) Yeezy in your Serato?"

Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(I saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my (EXPLICIT) get it, get it?
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said "take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip said, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a (EXPLICIT) roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in (EXPLICIT) coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my (EXPLICIT), x and o
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack (EXPLICIT)
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, it's like that y'all
I don't really give a (EXPLICIT) about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black (EXPLICIT)
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, (EXPLICIT)
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
(EXPLICIT) hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, downLetra - Power - Kanye West
Im livin in the 21st century
Doin something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin, I just count the hours
Stop trippin, Im trippin off the power
(21st century schizoid man)
The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We aint got nothin to lose, maf-cka, we rollin
Huh? Maf-cka, we rollin
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white mans world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin
Huh? I see you in the mornin
This is way too much, I need a moment
No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin, I just count the hours
Stop trippin, Im trippin off the power
Til then, f-ck that, the Worlds ours
And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)

F-ck SNL and the whole cast
Tell em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
Im an asshole? You n-ggas gotÂ jokes
You short-minded n-ggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He know, he so, f-ckin gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being prodded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin up with me
Takin my inner child, Im fighting for it, custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece
N-gga, no one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin, I just count the hours
Stop trippin, Im trippin off the power
Til then, f-ck that, the Worlds ours
And then they (Go)

Livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what!
We headin' to hell for heaven's sake, Huh!
Well I'mma levitate, make the devil wait, Yeah!
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life
Never in your wildest dreams, never in your wildest dreams
In your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams, comin' from inside the screen
You a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang bang bang bang bang
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life
One day I'm gon' marry a porn star
We'll have a big ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bride's maid
She wanna role play, 'til I roll over
I'mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day
'Specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her they couldn't take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, "Get away."
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck with the lights on
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life
I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in a bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a lifeUs living as we do upside down.
And the new word to have is revolution.
People don't even want to hear the preacher
spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued.
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey.
The youngsters who were programmed to continue
fucking up woke up one night digging
Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys.
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes.
The signs of Truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina.
We learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal.
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault,
hosed down daily with a gagging perfume.
America was a bastard the illegitimate daughter of the mother country
whose legs were then spread around the world
and a rapist known as freedom, free doom.
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names
that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
in the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
and a children and some food to feed them every night.
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you.
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
